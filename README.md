Bio

My name is Blair Matthews and I am a teaching fellow at the University of St Andrews. I graduated with a PhD in Education from the University of Stirling and an MA in Educational Technology and TESOL from the University of Manchester.

I teach and coordinate two modules on our MSc TESOL: Technology for Teaching and English for Academic Purposes. My main interests are in educational technology and language learning, digital sociology (particularly in relation to education) and the experiences of international students at university.

I am interested in collaborating with learning technologists or language teachers who are interested in technology.
