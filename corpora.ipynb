      "My Dear Sir: I am happy to assure you that your anxiety is without reason. Flemming will be confined to the sofa for three or four weeks, and will have to be careful at first how he uses his leg. A fracture of this kind is always a tedious affair. Fortunately the bone was very skilfully set by the surgeon who chanced to be in the drugstore where Flemming was brought after his fall, and I apprehend no permanent inconvenience from the accident. Flemming is doing perfectly well physically; but I must confess that the irritable and morbid state of mind into which he has fallen causes me a great deal of uneasiness. He is the last man in the world who ought to break his leg. You know how impetuous our friend is ordinarily, what a soul of restlessness and energy, never content unless he is rushing at some object, like a sportive bull at a red shawl; but amiable withal. He is no longer amiable. His temper has become something frightful. Miss Fanny Flemming came up from Newport, where the family are staying for the summer, to nurse him; but he packed her off the next morning in tears. He has a complete set of Balzac's works, twenty-seven volumes, piled up near his sofa, to throw at Watkins whenever that exemplary serving-man appears with his meals. Yesterday I very innocently brought Flemming a small basket of lemons. You know it was a strip of lemonpeel on the curbstone that caused our friend's mischance. Well, he no sooner set is eyes upon those lemons than he fell into such a rage as I cannot adequately describe. This is only one of moods, and the least distressing. At other times he sits with bowed head regarding his splintered limb, silent, sullen, despairing. When this fit is on him--and it sometimes lasts all day--nothing can distract his melancholy. He refuses to eat, does not even read the newspapers; books, except as projectiles for Watkins, have no charms for him. His state is truly pitiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if he were a poor man, with a family depending on his daily labor, this irritability and despondency would be natural enough. But in a young fellow of twenty-four, with plenty of money and seemingly not a care in the world, the thing is monstrous. If he continues to give way to his vagaries in this manner, he will end by bringing on an inflammation of the fibula. It was the fibula he broke. I am at my wits' end to know what to prescribe for him. I have anaesthetics and lotions, to make people sleep and to soothe pain; but I've no medicine that will make a man have a little common-sense. That is beyond my skill, but maybe it is not beyond yours. You are Flemming's intimate friend, his fidus Achates. Write to him, write to him frequently, distract his mind, cheer him up, and prevent him from becoming a confirmed case of melancholia. Perhaps he has some important plans disarranged by his present confinement. If he has you will know, and will know how to advise him judiciously. I trust your father finds the change beneficial? I am, my dear sir, with great respect, etc.\n",

      "My Dear Jack: I had a line from Dillon this morning, and was rejoiced to learn that your hurt is not so bad as reported. Like a certain personage, you are not so black and blue as you are painted. Dillon will put you on your pins again in two to three weeks, if you will only have patience and follow his counsels. Did you get my note of last Wednesday? I was greatly troubled when I heard of the accident.\n",

      "I can imagine how tranquil and saintly you are with your leg in a trough! It is deuced awkward, to be sure, just as we had promised ourselves a glorious month together at the sea-side; but we must make the best of it. It is unfortunate, too, that my father's health renders it impossible for me to leave him. I think he has much improved; the sea air is his native element; but he still needs my arm to lean upon in his walks, and requires some one more careful that a servant to look after him. I cannot come to you, dear Jack, but I have hours of unemployed time on hand, and I will write you a whole post-office full of letters, if that will divert you. Heaven knows, I haven't anything to write about. It isn't as if we were living at one of the beach houses; then I could do you some character studies, and fill your imagination with groups of sea-goddesses, with their (or somebody else's) raven and blonde manes hanging down their shoulders. You should have Aphrodite in morning wrapper, in evening costume, and in her prettiest bathing suit. But we are far from all that here. We have rooms in a farm-house, on a cross-road, two miles from the hotels, and lead the quietest of lives.\n",

      "I wish I were a novelist. This old house, with its sanded floors and high wainscots, and its narrow windows looking out upon a cluster of pines that turn themselves into aeolian harps every time the wind blows, would be the place in which to write a summer romance. It should be a story with the odors of the forest and the breath of the sea in it. It should be a novel like one of that Russian fellow's--what's his name?--Tourguenieff, Turguenef, Turgenif, Toorguniff, Turgenjew--nobody knows how to spell him. Yet I wonder if even a Liza or an Alexandra Paulovna could stir the heart of a man who has constant twinges in his leg. I wonder if one of our own Yankee girls of the best type, haughty and spirituelle, would be of any comfort to you in your present deplorable condition. If I thought so, I would hasten down to the Surf House and catch one for you; or, better still, I would find you one over the way.\n",

      "Picture to yourself a large white house just across the road, nearly opposite our cottage. It is not a house, but a mansion, built, perhaps, in the colonial period, with rambling extensions, and gambrel roof, and a wide piazza on three sides--a self- possessed, high-bred piece of architecture, with its nose in the air. It stands back from the road, and has an obsequious retinue of fringed elms and oaks and weeping willows. Sometimes in the morning, and oftener in the afternoon, when the sun has withdrawn from that part of the mansions, a young woman appears on the piazza with some mysterious Penelope web of embroidery in her hand, or a book. There is a hammock over there--of pineapple fibre, it looks from here. A hammock is very becoming when one is eighteen, and has golden hair, and dark eyes, and an emerald-colored illusion dress looped up after the fashion of a Dresden china shepherdess, and is chaussee like a belle of the time of Louis Quatorze. All this splendor goes into that hammock, and sways there like a pond-lily in the golden afternoon. The window of my bedroom looks down on that piazza--and so do I.\n",

      "I lie from morning till night on a lounge, staring into the hot street. Everybody is out of town enjoying himself. The brown-stone- front houses across the street resemble a row of particularly ugly coffins set up on end. A green mould is settling on the names of the deceased, carved on the silver door-plates. Sardonic spiders have sewed up the key-holes. All is silence and dust and desolation. --I interrupt this a moment, to take a shy at Watkins with the second volume of Cesar Birotteau. Missed him! I think I could bring him down with a copy of Sainte-Beuve or the Dictionnaire Universel, if I had it. These small Balzac books somehow do not quite fit my hand; but I shall fetch him yet. I've an idea that Watkins is tapping the old gentleman's Chateau Yquem. Duplicate key of the wine-cellar. Hibernian swarries in the front basement. Young Cheops up stairs, snug in his cerements. Watkins glides into my chamber, with that colorless, hypocritical face of his drawn out long like an accordion; but I know he grins all the way down stairs, and is glad I have broken my leg. Was not my evil star in the very zenith when I ran up to town to attend that dinner at Delmonico's? I didn't come up altogether for that. It was partly to buy Frank Livingstone's roan mare Margot. And now I shall not be able to sit in the saddle these two months. I'll send the mare down to you at The Pines--is that the name of the place?\n",

      "Old Dillon fancies that I have something on my mind. He drives me wild with lemons. Lemons for a mind diseased! Nonsense. I am only as restless as the devil under this confinement--a thing I'm not used to. Take a man who has never had so much as a headache or a toothache in his life, strap one of his legs in a section of water- spout, keep him in a room in the city for weeks, with the hot weather turned on, and then expect him to smile and purr and be happy! It is preposterous. I can't be cheerful or calm.\n",

Anything will do. Write me more about that little girl in the hammock. That was very pretty, all that about the Dresden china shepherdess and the pond-lily; the imagery a little mixed, perhaps, but very pretty. I didn't suppose you had so much sentimental furniture in your upper story. It shows how one may be familiar for years with the reception-room of his neighbor, and never suspect what is directly under his mansard. I supposed your loft stuffed with dry legal parchments, mortgages, and affidavits; you take down a package of manuscript, and lo! there are lyrics and sonnets and canzonettas. You really have a graphic descriptive touch, Edward Delaney, and I suspect you of anonymous love-tales in the magazines.\n",

You cannot imagine how this will occupy me. The more trifling, the better. My imprisonment has weakened me intellectually to such a degree that I find your epistolary gifts quite considerable. I am passing into my second childhood. In a week or two I shall take to India rubber rings and prongs of coral. A silver cup, with an appropriate inscription, would be a delicate attention on your part. In the mean time, write!\n",

But truly, Jack, I have a hard task. There is literally nothing here--except the little girl over the way. She is swinging in the hammock at this moment. It is to me compensation for many of the ills of life to see her now and then put out a small kid boot, which fits like a glove, and set herself going. Who is she, and what is her name? Her name is Daw. Only daughter if Mr. Richard W. Daw, ex-colonel and banker. Mother dead. One brother at Harvard, elder brother killed at the battle of Fair Oaks, ten years ago. Old, rich family, the Daws. This is the homestead, where father and daughter pass eight months of the twelve; the rest of the year in Baltimore and Washington. The New England winter too many for the old gentleman. The daughter is called Marjorie--Marjorie Daw. Sounds odd at first, doesn't it? But after you say it over to yourself half a dozen times, you like it. There's a pleasing quaintness to it, something prim and violet-like. Must be a nice sort of girl to be called Marjorie Daw.\n",

Of course I shall make the acquaintance of my neighbors before many days. It will be next to impossible for me not to meet Mr. Daw or Miss Daw in some of my walks. The young lady has a favorite path to the sea-beach. I shall intercept her some morning, and touch my hat to her. Then the princess will bend her fair head to me with courteous surprise not unmixed with haughtiness. Will snub me, in fact. All this for thy sake, O Pasha of the Snapt Axle-tree!. . . How oddly things fall out! Ten minutes ago I was called down to the parlor--you know the kind of parlors in farm-houses on the coast, a sort of amphibious parlor, with sea-shells on the mantel-piece and spruce branches in the chimney-place--where I found my father and Mr. Daw doing the antique polite to each other. He had come to pay his respects to his new neighbors. Mr. Daw is a tall, slim gentleman of about fifty-five, with a florid face and snow-white mustache and side-whiskers. Looks like Mr. Dombey, or as Mr. Dombey would have looked if he had served a few years in the British Army. Mr. Daw was a colonel in the late war, commanding the regiment in which his son was a lieutenant. Plucky old boy, backbone of New Hampshire granite. Before taking his leave, the colonel delivered himself of an invitation as if he were issuing a general order. Miss Daw has a few friends coming, at 4 p.m., to play croquet on the lawn (parade-ground) and have tea (cold rations) on the piazza. Will we honor them with our company? (or be sent to the guard- house.) My father declines on the plea of ill-health. My father's son bows with as much suavity as he knows, and accepts.\n",

      "In my next I shall have something to tell you. I shall have seen the little beauty face to face. I have a presentiment, Jack, that this Daw is a rara avis! Keep up your spirits, my boy, until I write you another letter--and send me along word how's your leg.\n",

      "The party, my dear Jack, was as dreary as possible. A lieutenant of the navy, the rector of the Episcopal Church at Stillwater, and a society swell from Nahant. The lieutenant looked as if he had swallowed a couple of his buttons, and found the bullion rather indigestible; the rector was a pensive youth, of the daffydowndilly sort; and the swell from Nahant was a very weak tidal wave indeed. The women were much better, as they always are; the two Miss Kingsburys of Philadelphia, staying at the Seashell House, two bright and engaging girls. But Marjorie Daw!\n",
      "\n",
      "The company broke up soon after tea, and I remained to smoke a cigar with the colonel on the piazza. It was like seeing a picture, to see Miss Marjorie hovering around the old soldier, and doing a hundred gracious little things for him. She brought the cigars and lighted the tapers with her own delicate fingers, in the most enchanting fashion. As we sat there, she came and went in the summer twilight, and seemed, with her white dress and pale gold hair, like some lovely phantom that had sprung into existence out of the smokewreaths. If she had melted into air, like the statue of Galatea in the play, I should have been more sorry than surprised.\n",

      "It was easy to perceive that the old colonel worshipped her and she him. I think the relation between an elderly father and a daughter just blooming into womanhood the most beautiful possible. There is in it a subtile sentiment that cannot exist in the case of mother and daughter, or that of son and mother. But this is getting into deep water.\n",

      "I sat with the Daws until half past ten, and saw the moon rise on the sea. The ocean, that had stretched motionless and black against the horizon, was changed by magic into a broken field of glittering ice, interspersed with marvellous silvery fjords. In the far distance the Isle of Shoals loomed up like a group of huge bergs drifting down on us. The Polar Regions in a June thaw! It was exceedingly fine. What did we talk about? We talked about the weather--and you! The weather has been disagreeable for several days past--and so have you. I glided from one topic to the other very naturally. I told my friends of your accident; how it had frustrated all our summer plans, and what our plans were. I played quite a spirited solo on the fibula. Then I described you; or, rather, I didn't. I spoke of your amiability, of your patience under this severe affliction; of your touching gratitude when Dillon brings you little presents of fruit; of your tenderness to your sister Fanny, whom you would not allow to stay in town to nurse you, and how you heroically sent her back to Newport, preferring to remain alone with Mary, the cook, and your man Watkins, to whom, by the way, you were devotedly attached. If you had been there, Jack, you wouldn't have known yourself. I should have excelled as a criminal lawyer, if I had not turned my attention to a different branch of jurisprudence. \n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Marjorie asked all manner of leading questions concerning you. It did not occur to me then, but it struck me forcibly afterwards, that she evinced a singular interest in the conversation. When I got back to my room, I recalled how eagerly she leaned forward, with her full, snowy throat in strong moonlight, listening to what I said. Positively, I think I made her like you!\n",

      "I am glad that the Daws are such pleasant people. The Pines is an isolated spot, and my resources are few. I fear I should have found life here somewhat monotonous before long, with no other society than that of my excellent sire.

I haven't hurled anything at Watkins since last Sunday, partly because I have grown more amiable under your teaching, and partly because Watkins captured my ammunition one night, and carried it off to the library. He is rapidly losing the habit he had acquired of dodging whenever I rub my ear, or make any slight motion with my right arm. He is still suggestive of the wine-cellar, however. You may break, you may shatter Watkins, if you will, but the scent of the Roederer will hang round him still.\n",

      "Ned, that Miss Daw must be a charming person. I should certainly like her. I like her already. When you spoke in your first letter of seeing a young girl swinging in a hammock under your chamber window, I was somehow strangely drawn to her. I cannot account for it in the least. What you have subsequently written of Miss Daw has strengthened the impression. You seem to be describing a woman I have known in some previous state of existence, or dreamed of in this. Upon my word, if you were to send me her photograph, I believe I should recognize her at a glance. Her manner, that listening attitude, her traits of character, as you indicate them, the light hair and the dark eyes--they are all familiar things to me. Asked a lot of questions, did she? Curious about me? That is strange.\n",

How cool it must be down there! I long for the salt smell in the air. I picture the colonel smoking his cheroot on the piazza. I send you and Miss Daw off on afternoon rambles along the beach. Sometimes I let you stroll with her under the elms in the moonlight, for you are great friends by this time, I take it, and see each other every day. I know your ways and your manners! Then I fall into a truculent mood, and would like to destroy somebody. Have you noticed anything in the shape of a lover hanging around the colonel Lares and Penates? Does that lieutenant of the horse-marines or that young Stillwater parson visit the house much? Not that I am pining for news of them, but any gossip of the kind would be in order. I wonder, Ned, you don't fall in love with Miss Daw. I am ripe to do it myself. Speaking of photographs, couldn't you manage to slip one of her cartes-de-visite from her album--she must have an album, you know--and send it to me? I will return it before it could be missed.

The colonel and my father smoke their afternoon cigar together in our sitting-room or on the piazza opposite, and I pass an hour or two of the day or the evening with the daughter. I am more and more struck by the beauty, modesty, and intelligence of Miss Daw.\n",
      "\n",
      "You asked me why I do not fall in love with her. I will be frank, Jack; I have thought of that. She is young, rich, accomplished, uniting in herself more attractions, mental and personal, than I can recall in any girl of my acquaintance; but she lacks the something that would be necessary to inspire in me that kind of interest. Possessing this unknown quality, a woman neither beautiful nor wealthy nor very young could bring me to her feet. But not Miss Daw. If we were shipwrecked together on an uninhabited island--let me suggest a tropical island, for it costs no more to be picturesque--I would build her a bamboo hut, I would fetch her bread-fruit and cocoanuts, I would fry yams for her, I would lure the ingenuous turtle and make her nourishing soups, but I wouldn't make love to her--not under eighteen months. I would like to have her for a sister, that I might shield her and counsel her, and spend half my income on old threadlace and camel's-hair shawls. (We are off the island now.) If such were not my feeling, there would still be an obstacle to my loving Miss Daw. A greater misfortune could scarcely befall me than to love her. Flemming, I am about to make a revelation that will astonish you. I may be all wrong in my premises and consequently in my conclusions; but you shall judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night when I returned to my room after the croquet party at the Daw's, and was thinking over the trivial events of the evening, I was suddenly impressed by the air of eager attention with which Miss Daw had followed my account of your accident. I think I mentioned this to you. Well, the next morning, as I went to mail my letter, I overtook Miss Daw on the road to Rye, where the post- office is, and accompanied her thither and back, an hour's walk. The conversation again turned to you, and again I remarked that inexplicable look of interest which had lighted up her face the previous evening. Since then, I have seen Miss Daw perhaps ten times, perhaps oftener, and on each occasion I found that when I was not speaking of you, or your sister, or some person or place associated with you, I was not holding her attention. She would be absent-minded, her eyes would wander away from me to the sea, or to some distant object in the landscape; her fingers would play with the leaves of a book in a way that convinced me she was not listening. At these moments if I abruptly changed the theme--I did it several times as an experiment--and dropped some remark about my friend Flemming, then the sombre blue eyes would come back to me instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, is not this the oddest thing in the world? No, not the oddest. The effect which you tell me was produced on you by my casual mention of an unknown girl swinging in a hammock is certainly as strange. You can conjecture how that passage in your letter of Friday startled me. Is it possible, than, that two people who have never met, and who are hundreds of miles apart, can exert a magnetic influence on each other? I have read of such psychological phenomena, but never credited them. I leave the solution of the problem to you. As for myself, all other things being favorable, it would be impossible for me to fall in love with a woman who listens to me only when I am talking of my friend!\n",

      "I am not aware that any one is paying marked attention to my fair neighbor. The lieutenant of the navy--he is stationed at Rivermouth --sometimes drops in of an evening, and sometimes the rector from Stillwater; the lieutenant the oftener. He was there last night. I should not be surprised if he had an eye to the heiress; but he is not formidable. Mistress Daw carries a neat little spear of irony, and the honest lieutenant seems to have a particular facility for impaling himself on the point of it. He is not dangerous, I should say; though I have known a woman to satirize a man for years, and marry him after all. Decidedly, the lowly rector is not dangerous; yet, again, who has not seen Cloth of Frieze victorious in the lists where Cloth of Gold went down?\n",

      "Your letter in reply to my last has occupied my thoughts all the morning. I do not know what to think. Do you mean to say that you are seriously half in love with a woman whom you have never seen-- with a shadow, a chimera? for what else can Miss Daw to be you? I do not understand it at all. I understand neither you nor her. You are a couple of ethereal beings moving in finer air than I can breathe with my commonplace lungs. Such delicacy of sentiment is something that I admire without comprehending. I am bewildered. I am of the earth earthy, and I find myself in the incongruous position of having to do with mere souls, with natures so finely tempered that I run some risk of shattering them in my awkwardness. I am as Caliban among the spirits!\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting on your letter, I am not sure that it is wise in me to continue this correspondence. But no, Jack; I do wrong to doubt the good sense that forms the basis of your character. You are deeply interested in Miss Daw; you feel that she is a person whom you may perhaps greatly admire when you know her: at the same time you bear in mind that the chances are ten to five that, when you do come to know her, she will fall far short of your ideal, and you will not care for her in the least. Look at it in this sensible light, and I will hold back nothing from you.\n",

      "\tYesterday afternoon my father and myself rode over to Rivermouth with the Daws. A heavy rain in the morning had cooled the atmosphere and laid the dust. To Rivermouth is a drive of eight miles, along a winding road lined all the way with wild barberry bushes. I never saw anything more brilliant than these bushes, the green of the foliage and the faint blush of the berries intensified by the rain. The colonel drove, with my father in front, Miss Daw and I on the back seat. I resolved that for the first five miles your name should not pass my lips. I was amused by the artful attempts she made, at the start, to break through my reticence. Then a silence fell upon her; and then she became suddenly gay. That keenness which I enjoyed so much when it was exercised on the lieutenant was not so satisfactory directed against myself. Miss Daw has great sweetness of disposition, but she can be disagreeable. She is like the young lady in the rhyme, with the curl on her forehead,\n",

If the negative turns out well, I am to have a copy. So our ends will be accomplished without crime.

These letters are undated, but in what I take to be the latest are two passages that require my consideration. You will pardon my candor, dear Flemming, but the conviction forces itself upon me that as your leg grows stronger your head becomes weaker. You ask my advice on a certain point. I will give it. In my opinion you could do nothing more unwise that to address a note to Miss Daw, thanking her for the flower. It would, I am sure, offend her delicacy beyond pardon. She knows you only through me; you are to her an abstraction, a figure in a dream--a dream from which the faintest shock would awaken her.

Marjorie has told her father everything! I saw her for a few minutes, an hour ago, in the garden; and, as near as I could gather from her confused statement, the facts are these: Lieutenant Bradly--that's the naval officer stationed at Rivermouth--has been paying court to Miss Daw for some time past, but not so much to her liking as to that of the colonel, who it seems is an old fiend of the young gentleman's father. Yesterday (I knew she was in some trouble when she drove up to our gate) the colonel spoke to Marjorie of Bradly --urged his suit, I infer. Marjorie expressed her dislike for the lieutenant with characteristic frankness, and finally confessed to her father--well, I really do not know what she confessed. It must have been the vaguest of confessions, and must have sufficiently puzzled the colonel. At any rate, it exasperated him. I suppose I am implicated in the matter, and that the colonel feels bitterly towards me. I do not see why: I have carried no messages between you and Miss Daw; I have behaved with the greatest discretion. I can find no flaw anywhere in my proceeding.

      "\tOn the second day of September, 1872, as the down express, due at 3.40, left the station at Hampton, a young man, leaning on the shoulder of a servant, whom he addressed as Watkins, stepped from the platform into a hack, and requested to be driven to \"The Pines.\" On arriving at the gate of a modest farm-house, a few miles from the station, the young man descended with difficulty from the carriage, and, casting a hasty glance across the road, seemed much impressed by some peculiarity in the landscape. Again leaning on the shoulder of the person Watkins, he walked to the door of the farm-house and inquired for Mr. Edward Delaney. He was informed by the aged man who answered his knock, that Mr. Edward Delaney had gone to Boston the day before, but that Mr. Jonas Delaney was within. This information did not appear satisfactory to the stranger, who inquired if Mr. Edward Delaney had left any message for Mr. John Flemming. There was a letter for Mr. Flemming if he were that person. After a brief absence the aged man reappeared with a Letter.\n",

      "\t\"The whole show is dreadful,\" she cried, coming out of the menagerie of M. Martin. She had just been looking at that daring speculator \"working with his hyena\"--to speak in the style of the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By what means,\" she continued, \"can he have tamed these animals to such a point as to be certain of their affection for----.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nevertheless,\" I continued, \"the first time I saw M. Martin, I admit, like you, I did give vent to an exclamation of surprise. I found myself next to an old soldier with the right leg amputated, who had come in with me. His face had struck me. He had one of those intrepid heads, stamped with the seal of warfare, and on which the battles of Napoleon are written. Besides, he had that frank good-humored expression which always impresses me favorably. He was without doubt one of those troopers who are surprised at nothing, who find matter for laughter in the contortions of a dying comrade, who bury or plunder him quite lightheartedly, who stand intrepidly in the way of bullets; in fact, one of those men who waste no time in deliberation, and would not hesitate to make friends with the devil himself. After looking very attentively at the proprietor of the menagerie getting out of his box, my companion pursed up his lips with an air of mockery and contempt, with that peculiar and expressive twist which superior people assume to show they are not taken in. Then when I was expatiating on the courage of M. Martin, he smiled, shook his head knowingly, and said, `Well known.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How `well known'? I said. `If you would only explain to me the mystery I should be vastly obliged.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After a few minutes, during which we made acquaintance, we went to dine at the first restaurateur's whose shop caught our eye. At dessert a bottle of champagne completely refreshed and brightened up the memories of this odd old soldier. He told me his story, and I said he had every reason to exclaim, `Well known.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got home, she teased me to that extent and made so many promises that I consented to communicate to her the old soldier's confidences. Next day she received the following episode of an epic which one might call \"The Frenchman in Egypt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During the expedition in Upper Egypt under General Desaix, a Provençal soldier fell into the hands of the Mangrabins, and was taken by these Arabs into the deserts beyond the falls of the Nile.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to place a sufficient distance between themselves and the French army, the Mangrabins made forced marches, and only rested during the night. They camped round a well overshadowed by palm trees under which they had previously concealed a store of provisions. Not surmising that the notion of flight would occur to their prisoner, they contented themselves with binding his hands, and after eating a few dates, and giving provender to their horses, went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the brave Provençal saw that his enemies were no longer watching him, he made use of his teeth to steal a scimitar, fixed the blade between his knees, and cut the cords which prevented using his hands; in a moment he was free. He at once seized a rifle and dagger, then taking the precaution to provide himself with a sack of dried dates, oats, and powder and shot, and to fasten a scimitar to his waist he leaped onto a horse, and spurred on vigorously in the direction where he thought to find the French army. So impatient was he to see a bivouac again that he pressed on the already-tired courser at such speed that its flanks were lacerated with his spurs, and at last the poor animal died, leaving the Frenchman alone in the desert. After walking some time in the sand with all the courage of an escaped convict, the soldier was obliged to stop, as the day had already ended. In spite of the beauty of an Oriental sky at night, he felt he had not strength enough to go on. Fortunately he had been able to find a small hill, on the summit of which a few palm trees shot up into the air; it was their verdure seen from afar which had brought hope and consolation to his heart. His fatigue was so great that he lay down upon a rock of granite, capriciously cut out like a camp bed; there he fell asleep without taking any precaution to defend himself while he slept. He had made the sacrifice of his life. His last thought was one of regret. He repented having left the  mangrabins, whose nomad life seemed to smile on him now that he was afar from them and without help. He was awakened by the sun, whose pitiless rays fell with all their force on the granite and produced an intolerable heat for he had had the stupidity to place himself inversely to the shadow thrown by the verdant majestic heads of the palm trees. He looked at the solitary trees and shuddered--they reminded him of the graceful shafts crowned with foliage which characterize the Saracen columns in the cathedral of Arles.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when, after counting the palm trees, he cast his eye around him, the most horrible despair was infused into his soul. Before him stretched an ocean without limit. The dark sand of the desert spread farther than sight could reach in every direction, and glittered like steel struck with a bright light. It might have been a sea of looking glass, or lakes melted together in a mirror. A fiery vapor carried up in streaks made a perpetual whirlwind over the quivering land. The sky was lit with an Oriental splendor of insupportable purity, leaving naught for the imagination to desire. Heaven and earth were on fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The silence was awful in its wild and terrible majesty. Infinity, immensity, closed in upon the soul from every side. Not a cloud in the sky, not a breath in the air, not a flaw on the bosom of the sand, ever moving in diminutive waves; the horizon ended as at sea on a clear day, with one line of light, definite as the cut of a sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Provençal threw his arms around the trunk of one of the palm trees, as though it were the body of a friend, and then in the shelter of the thin straight shadow that the palm cast upon the granite, he wept. Then sitting down he remained as he was, contemplating with profound sadness the implacable scene, which was all he had to look upon. He cried aloud, to measure the solitude. His voice, lost in the hollows of the hill, sounded faintly, and aroused no echo--the echo was in his own heart. The Provençal was twenty-two years old; he loaded his carbine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There'll be time enough,\" he said to himself, laying on the ground the weapon which alone could bring him deliverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking by turns at the black expanse and the blue expanse, the soldier  dreamed of France--he smelled with delight the gutters of Paris--he remembered the towns through which he had passed, the faces of his fellow soldiers, the most minute details of his life. His southern fancy soon showed him the stones of his beloved Provence, in the play of the heat which waved over the spread sheet of the desert. Fearing the danger of this cruel mirage, he went down the opposite side of the hill to that by which he had come up the day before. The remains of a rug showed that this place of refuge had at one time been inhabited; at a short distance he saw some palm trees full of dates. Then the instinct which binds us to life awoke again in his heart. He hoped to live long enough to await the passing of some Arabs, or perhaps he might hear the sound of cannon, for at this time Bonaparte was traversing Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This thought gave him new life. The palm tree seemed to bend with the weight of the ripe fruit. He shook some of it down. When he tasted this unhoped-for manna, he felt sure that the palms had been cultivated by a former inhabitant--the savory, fresh meat of the dates was proof of the care of his predecessor. He passed suddenly from dark despair to an almost insane joy. He went up again to the top of the hill, and spent the rest of the day in cutting down one of the sterile palm trees, which the night before had served him for shelter. A vague memory made him think of the animals of the desert; and in case they might come to drink at the spring, visible from the base of the rocks but lost farther down, he resolved to guard himself from their visits by placing a barrier at the entrance of his hermitage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of his diligence, and the strength which the fear of being devoured asleep gave him, he was unable to cut the palm in pieces, though he succeeded in cutting it down. At eventide the king of the desert fell; the sound of its fall resounded far and wide, like a sign the solitude; the soldier shuddered as though he had heard some voice predicting woe.\n",
      "\n",
      "But like an heir who does not long bewail a deceased parent, he tore off from this beautiful tree the tall broad green leaves which are its poetic adornment, and used them to mend the mat on which he was to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatigued by the heat and his work, he fell asleep under the red curtains of his wet cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of the night his sleep was troubled by an extraordinary noise; he sat up, and the deep silence around him allowed him to distinguish the alternative accents of a respiration whose savage energy could not belong to a human creature.\n",
      "\n",
      "A profound terror, increased still further by the darkness, the silence, and his waking images, froze his heart within him. He almost felt his hair stand on end, when by straining his eyes to their utmost he perceived through the shadows two faint yellow lights. At first he attributed these lights to the reflection of his own pupils, but soon the vivid brilliance of the night aided him gradually to distinguish the objects around him in the cave, and he beheld a huge animal lying but two steps from him. Was it a lion, a tiger, or a crocodile?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Provençal was not educated enough to know under what species his enemy ought to be classed; but his fright was all the greater, as his ignorance led him to imagine an terrors at once; he endured a cruel torture, noting every variation of the breathing close to him without daring to make the slightest movement. An odor, pungent like that of a fox, but more penetrating, profounder--so to speak--filled the cave, and when the Provençal became sensible of this, his terror reached its height, for he could not longer doubt the proximity of a terrible companion, whose royal dwelling served him for shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the reflection of the moon, descending on the horizon, lit up the den, rendering gradually visible and resplendent the spotted skin of a panther.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lion of Egypt slept, curled up like a big dog, the peaceful possessor of a sumptuous niche at the gate of a hotel; its eyes opened for a moment and closed again; its face was turned toward the man. A thousand confused thoughts passed through the Frenchman's mind first he thought of killing it with a bullet from his gun, but he saw there was not enough distance between them for him to take proper aim--the shot would miss the mark. And if it were to wake!--the thought made his limbs rigid. He listened to his own heart beating in the midst of' the silence, and cursed the too violent pulsations which the flow of blood brought on, fearing to disturb that sleep which allowed him time to think of some means of escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice he placed his hand on his scimitar, intending to cut off the head of his enemy; but the difficulty of cutting stiff, short hair compelled him to abandon this daring project. To miss would be to die for certain, he thought; he preferred the chances of fair fight, and made up his mind to wait till morning; the morning did not leave him long to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could now examine the panther at ease; its muzzle was smeared with blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's had a good dinner,\" he thought, without troubling himself as to whether her feast might have been on human flesh \"She won't be hungry when she gets up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a female. The fur on her belly and flanks was glistening white; many small\n",
      "marks like velvet formed beautiful bracelets round her feet; her sinuous tail was also white, ending with black rings; the overpart of her dress, yellow like unburnished gold, very lissome and soft, had the characteristic blotches the form of rosettes which distinguish the panther from every other feline species.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tranquil and formidable hostess snored in an attitude as graceful as that of a cat lying on a cushion. Her bloodstained paws, nervous and well armed, were stretched out before her face, which rested upon them, and from which radiated her straight, slender whiskers, like threads of silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she had been like that in a cage, the Provençal would doubtless have admired the grace of the animal, and the vigorous contrasts of vivid color which gave her robe an imperial splendor; but just then his sight was troubled by her sinister appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of the panther, even asleep, could not fail to produce the effect which the magnetic eyes of the serpent are said to have on the nightingale.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the courage of the soldier began to fail before this danger, though no doubt it would have risen at the mouth of a cannon charged with shell. Nevertheless, a bold thought brought daylight in his soul and sealed up the source of the cold sweat which sprang forth on his brow. Like men driven to bay who defy death and offer their body to the smiter, so he, seeing in this merely a tragic episode, resolved to play his part with honor to the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The day before yesterday the Arabs would have killed me perhaps,\" he said; so considering himself as good as dead already, he waited bravely, with excited curiosity his enemy's awakening.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun appeared, the panther suddenly opened her eyes; then she put out her paws with energy, as if to stretch them and get rid of cramp. At last she yawned, showing the formidable apparatus of her teeth and pointed tongue, rough as a file.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A regular petite maîtresse,\" thought the Frenchman, seeing her roll herself about so softly and coquettishly. She licked off the blood which stained her paws and muzzle, and scratched her head with reiterated gestures full of prettiness. \"All right, make a little toilet,\" the Frenchman said to himself, beginning to recover his gaiety with his courage; \"we'll say good morning to each other presently,\" and he seized the small, short dagger which he had taken from the Mangrabins. At this moment the panther turned her head toward the man and looked at him fixedly without moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rigidity of her metallic eyes and their insupportable luster made him shudder, especially when the animal walked toward him. But he looked at her caressingly, staring into her eyes in order to magnetize her, and let her come quite close to him; then with a movement both gentle and amorous, as though he were caressing the most beautiful of women, he passed his hand over her whole body, from the head to the tail, scratching the flexible vertebrae which divided the panther's yellow back. The animal waved her tail voluptuously, and her eyes grew gentle; and when for the third time the Frenchman accomplished this interesting flattery, she gave forth one of those purrings by which our cats express their pleasure; but this murmur issued from a throat so powerful and so deep that it resounded through the cave like the last vibrations of an organ in a church. The man, understanding the importance of his caresses, redoubled them in such a way as to surprise and stupefy his imperious courtesan. When he felt sure of having extinguished the ferocity of his capricious companion, whose hunger had so fortunately been satisfied the day before, he got up to go out of the cave; the panther let him go out, but when he had reached the summit of the hill she sprang with the lightness of a sparrow hopping from twig to twig, and rubbed herself against his legs, putting up her back after the manner of all the race of cats. Then regarding her guest with eyes whose glare had softened a little, she gave vent to that wild cry which naturalists compare to the grating of a saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is exacting,\" said the Frenchman, smilingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was bold enough to play with her ears; he caressed her belly and scratched her head as hard as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw that he was successful, he tickled her skull with the point of his dagger, watching for the right moment to kill her, but the hardness of her bones made him tremble for his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sultana of the desert showed herself gracious to her slave; she lifted her head,\n",
      "stretched out her and manifested her delight by - the tranquility of her attitude. It suddenly occurred to the soldier that to kill this savage princess with one blow he must poignard her in the throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised the blade, when the panther, satisfied no doubt, laid herself gracefully at his feet, and cast up at him glances in which, in spite of their natural fierceness, was mingled confusedly a kind of good will. The poor Provençal ate his dates, leaning against one of the palm trees, and casting his eyes alternately on the desert in quest of some liberator and on his terrible companion to watch her uncertain clemency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The panther looked at the place where the date stones fell, and every time that he threw one down her eyes expressed an incredible mistrust.\n",
      "\n",
      "She examined the man with an almost commercial prudence. However, this examination was favorable to him, for when he had finished his meager meal she licked his boots with her powerful rough tongue, brushing off with marvelous skill the dust gathered in the creases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, but when she's really hungry!\" thought the Frenchman. In spite of the shudder this thought caused him, the soldier began to measure curiously the proportions of the panther, certainly one of the most splendid specimens of its race. She was three feet high and four feet long without counting her tail; this powerful weapon, rounded like a cudgel, was nearly three feet long. The head, large as that of a lioness, was distinguished by a rare expression of refinement. The cold cruelty of a tiger was dominant, it was true, but there was also a vague resemblance to the face of a sensual woman. Indeed, the face of this solitary queen had something of the gaiety of a drunken Nero: she had satiated herself with blood, and she wanted to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier tried if he might walk up and down, and the panther left him free, contenting herself with following him with her eyes, less like a faithful dog than a big Angora cat, observing everything and every movement of her master.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he looked around, he saw, by the spring, the remains of his horse; the panther had dragged the carcass all that way; about two thirds of it had been devoured already. The sight reassured him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was easy to explain the panther's absence, and the respect she had had for him while he slept. The first piece of good luck emboldened him to tempt the future, and he conceived the wild hope of continuing on good terms with the panther during the entire day, neglecting no means of taming her, and remaining her good graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned to her, and had the unspeakable joy of seeing her wag her tail with an almost imperceptible movement at his approach. He sat down then, without fear, by her side, and they began to play together; he took her paws and muzzle, pulled her ears, rolled her over on her back, stroked her warm, delicate flanks. She let him do what ever he liked, and when he began to stroke the hair on her feet she drew her claws in carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man, keeping the dagger in one hand, thought to plunge it into the belly of the too-confiding panther, but he was afraid that he would be immediately strangled in her last conclusive struggle; besides, he felt in his heart a sort of remorse which bid him respect a creature that had done him no harm. He seemed to have found a friend, in a boundless desert; half unconsciously he thought of his first sweetheart, whom he had nicknamed \"Mignonne\" by way of contrast, because she was so atrociously jealous that all the time of their love he was in fear of the knife with which she had always threatened him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This memory of his early days suggested to him the idea of making the young panther answer to this name, now that he began to admire with less terror her swiftness, suppleness, and softness. Toward the end of the day he had familiarized himself with his perilous position; he now almost liked the painfulness of it. At last his companion had got into the habit of looking up at him whenever he cried in a falsetto voice, \"Mignonne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the setting of the sun Mignonne gave, several times running, a profound melancholy cry. \"She's been well brought up,\" said the lighthearted soldier; \"she says her prayers.\" But this mental joke only occurred to him when he noticed what a pacific attitude his companion remained in. \"Come, ma petite blonde, I'll let you go to bed first,\" he said to her, counting on the activity of his own legs to run away as quickly as possible, directly she was asleep, and seek another shelter for the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier waited with impatience the hour of his flight, and when it had arrived he walked vigorously in the direction of the Nile; but hardly had he made a quarter of a league in the sand when he heard the panther bounding after him, crying with that sawlike cry more dreadful even than the sound of her leaping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" he said, \"then she's taken a fancy to me, she has never met anyone before, and it is really quite flattering to have her first love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That instant the man fell into one, of those movable quicksands so terrible to travelers and from which it is impossible to save oneself. Feeling himself caught, he gave a shriek of alarm; the panther seized him with her teeth by the collar, and, springing vigorously backward, drew him as if by magic out of the whirling sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, Mignonne!\" cried the soldier, caressing her enthusiastically; \"we're bound together for life and death but no jokes, mind!\" and he retraced his steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that time the desert seemed inhabited. It contained a being to whom the man could talk, and whose ferocity was rendered gentle by him, though he could not explain to himself the reason for their strange friendship. Great as was the soldier's desire to stay upon guard, he slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "On awakening he could not find Mignonne; he mounted the hill, and in the distance saw her springing toward him after the habit of these animals, who cannot run on account of the extreme flexibility of the vertebral column. Mignonne arrived, her jaws covered with blood; she received the wonted caress of her companion, showing with much purring how happy it made her. Her eyes, full of languor, turned still more gently than the day before toward the Provençal who talked to her as one would to a tame animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! Mademoiselle, you are a nice girl, aren't you? Just look at that! So we like to be made much of, don't we? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? So you have been eating some Arab or other, have you? That doesn't matter. They're animals just the same as you are; but don't you take to eating Frenchmen, or I shan't like you any longer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She played like a dog with its master, letting herself be rolled over, knocked about, and stroked, alternately; sometimes she herself would provoke the soldier, putting up her paw with a soliciting gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some days passed in this manner. This companionship permitted the Provençal to appreciate the sublime beauty of the desert; now that he had a living thing to think about, alternations of fear and quiet, and plenty to eat, his mind became filled with contrast and his life began to be diversified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solitude revealed to him all her secrets, and enveloped him in her delights. He discovered in the rising and setting of the sun sights unknown to the world. He knew what it was to tremble when he heard over his head the hiss of a bird's wing, so rarely did they pass, or when he saw the clouds, changing and many-colored travelers, melt one into another. He studied in the night time the effect of the moon upon the ocean of sand, where the simoom made waves swift of movement and rapid in their change. He lived the life of the Eastern day, marveling at its wonderful pomp; then, after having reveled in the sight of a hurricane over the plain where the whirling sands made red, dry mists and death-bearing clouds, he would welcome the night with joy, for then fell the healthful freshness of the stars, and he listened to imaginary music in the skies. Then solitude taught him to unroll the treasures of dreams. He passed whole hours in remembering mere nothings, and comparing his present life with his past.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he grew passionately fond of the panther; for some sort of affection was a necessity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it was that his will powerfully projected had modified the character of his companion, or whether, because she found abundant food in her predatory excursions in the desert, she respected the man's life, he began to fear for it no longer, seeing her so well tamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He devoted the greater part of his time to sleep, but he was obliged to watch like a spider knits web that the moment of his deliverance might not escape him, if anyone should pass the line marked by the horizon. He had sacrificed his shirt to make a flag with, which he hung at the top of a palm tree, whose foliage he had torn off. Taught by necessity, he found the means of keeping it spread out, by fastening it with little sticks; for the wind might not be blowing at the moment when the passing traveler was looking through the desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was during the long hours, when he had abandoned hope, that he amused himself with the panther. He had come to learn the different inflections of her voice, the expressions of her eyes; he had studied the capricious patterns of all the rosettes which marked the gold of her robe. Mignonne was not even angry when he took hold of the tuft at the end of her tail to count her rings, those graceful ornaments which glittered in the sun like jewelry. It gave him pleasure to contemplate the supple, fine outlines of her form, the whiteness of her belly, the graceful pose of her head. But it was especially when she was playing that he felt most pleasure in looking at her; the agility and youthful lightness of her movements were a continual surprise to him; he wondered at the supple way in which she jumped and climbed, washed herself and arranged her fur, crouched down and prepared to spring. However rapid her spring might be, however slippery the stone she was on, she would always stop short at the word \"Mignonne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, in a bright midday sun, an enormous bird coursed through the air. The man left his panther to look at this new guest; but after waiting a moment the deserted sultana growled deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My goodness! I do believe she's jealous,\" he cried, seeing her eyes become hard again; \"the soul of Virginie has passed into her body; that's certain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The eagle disappeared into the air, while the soldier admired the curved contour of the panther.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was such youth and grace in her form! she was beautiful as a woman! The blond fur of her robe mingled well with the delicate tints of faint white which marked her flanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The profuse light cast down by the sun made this living gold, these russet markings, to burn in a way to give them an indefinable attraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man and the panther looked at one another with a look full of meaning; the coquette quivered when she felt her friend stroke her head; her eyes flashed like lightning--then she shut them tightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has a soul,\" he said, looking at the stillness of this queen of the sands, golden like them, white like them, solitary and burning like them.\n",
      ". . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" she said, \"I have read your plea in favor of beasts; but how did two so well adapted to understand each other end?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, well! you see, they ended as all great passions do end--by a misunderstanding. For some reason one suspects the other of treason; they don't come to an explanation through pride, and quarrel and part from sheer obstinacy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet sometimes at the best moments a single word or a look is enough--but anyhow go on with your story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's horribly difficult, but you will understand, after what the old villain told me over his champagne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He said--`I don't know if I hurt her, but she turned round, as if enraged, and with her sharp teeth caught hold of my leg--gently, I daresay; but I, thinking she would devour me, plunged my dagger into her throat. She rolled over, giving a cry that froze my heart; and I saw her dying, still looking at me without anger. I would have given all the world--my cross even, which I lied not then--to have brought her to life again. It was as though I had murdered a real person; and the soldiers who had seen my flag, and were come to my assistance, found me in tears.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"`Well sir,' he said, after a moment of silence, `since then I have been in war in Germany, in Spain, in Russia, in France; I've certainly carried my carcass about a good deal, but never have I seen anything like the desert. Ah! yes, it is very beautiful!'\n",
      "\n",
      "\" 'What did you feel there?' I asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Oh! that can't be described, young man. Besides, I am not always regretting my palm trees and my panther. I should have to be very melancholy for that. In the desert, you see, there is everything and nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, but explain----'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Well,' he said, with an impatient gesture, 'it is God without mankind.'\"\n",

      "Many years ago, on my way from Hongkong to New York, I passed a week in San Francisco.  A long time had gone by since I had been in that city, during which my ventures in the Orient had prospered beyond my hope; I was rich and could afford to revisit my own country to renew my friendship with such of the companions of my youth as still lived and remembered me with the old affection.  Chief of these, I hoped, was Mohun Dampier, an old schoolmate with whom I had held a desultory correspondence which had long ceased, as is the way of correspondence between men.  You may have observed that the indisposition to write a merely social letter is in the ratio of the square of the distance between you and your correspondent.  It is a law.\n",
      "I remembered Dampier as a handsome, strong young fellow of scholarly tastes, with an aversion to work and a marked indifference to many of the things that the world cares for, including wealth, of which, however, he had inherited enough to put him beyond the reach of want.  In his family, one of the oldest and most aristocratic in the country, it was, I think, a matter of pride that no member of it had ever been in trade nor politics, nor suffered any kind of distinction.  Mohan was a trifle sentimental, and had in him a singular element of superstition, which led him to the study of all manner of occult subjects, although his sane mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and perilous faiths.  He made daring incursions into the realm of the unreal without renouncing his residence in the partly surveyed and charted region of what we are pleased to call certitude.\n",
      "The night of my visit to him was stormy.  The Californian winter was on, and the incessant rain splashed in the deserted streets, or, lifted by irregular gusts of wind, was hurled against the houses with incredible fury.  With no small difficulty my cabman found the right place, away out toward the ocean beach, in a sparsely populated suburb.  The dwelling, a rather ugly one, apparently, stood in the center of its grounds, which as nearly as I could make out in the gloom were destitute of either flowers or grass.  Three or four trees, writhing and moaning in the torment of the tempest, appeared to be trying to escape from their dismal environment and take the chance of finding a better one out at sea.  The house was a two-story brick structure with a tower, a story higher, at one corner.  In a window of that was the only visible light.  Something in the appearance of the place made me shudder, a performance that may have been assisted by a rill of rainwater down my back as I scuttled to cover in the doorway.\n",
      "In answer to my note apprising him of my wish to call, Dampier had written, 'Don't ring - open the door and come up.'  I did so.  The staircase was dimly lighted by a single gas-jet at the top of the second flight.  I managed to reach the landing without disaster and entered by an open door into the lighted square room of the tower.  Dampier came forward in gown and slippers to receive me, giving me the greeting that I wished, and if I had held a thought that it might more fitly have been accorded me at the front door the first look at him dispelled any sense of his inhospitality.\n",
      "He was not the same.  Hardly past middle age, he had gone gray and had acquired a pronounced stoop.  His figure was thin and angular, his face deeply lined, his complexion dead-white, without a touch of color.  His eyes, unnaturally large, glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny.\n",
      "He seated me, proffered a cigar, and with grave and obvious sincerity assured me of the pleasure that it gave him to meet me.  Some unimportant conversation followed, but all the while I was dominated by a melancholy sense of the great change in him.  This he must have perceived, for he suddenly said with a bright enough smile, 'You are disappointed in me - non sum qualis eram.'\n",
      "I hardly knew what to reply, but managed to say:  'Why, really, I don't know:  your Latin is about the same.'\n",
      "He brightened again.  'No,' he said, 'being a dead language, it grows in appropriateness.  But please have the patience to wait:  where I am going there is perhaps a better tongue.  Will you care to have a message in it?'\n",
      "The smile faded as he spoke, and as he concluded he was looking into my eyes with a gravity that distressed me.  Yet I would not surrender myself to his mood, nor permit him to see how deeply his prescience of death affected me.\n",
      "'I fancy that it will be long,' I said, 'before human speech will cease to serve our need; and then the need, with its possibilities of service, will have passed.'\n",
      "He made no reply, and I too was silent, for the talk had taken a dispiriting turn, yet I knew not how to give it a more agreeable character.  Suddenly, in a pause of the storm, when the dead silence was almost startling by contrast with the previous uproar, I heard a gentle tapping, which appeared to come from the wall behind my chair.  The sound was such as might have been made by a human hand, not as upon a door by one asking admittance, but rather, I thought, as an agreed signal, an assurance of someone's presence in an adjoining room; most of us, I fancy, have had more experience of such communications than we should care to relate.  I glanced at Dampier.  If possibly there was something of amusement in the look he did not observe it.  He appeared to have forgotten my presence, and was staring at the wall behind me with an expression in his eyes that I am unable to name, although my memory of it is as vivid to-day as was my sense of it then.  The situation was embarrassing!  I rose to take my leave.  At this he seemed to recover himself.\n",
      "'Please be seated,' he said; 'it is nothing - no one is there.'\n",
      "But the tapping was repeated, and with the same gentle, slow insistence as before.\n",
      "'Pardon me,' I said, 'it is late.  May I call tomorrow?'\n",
      "He smiled - a little mechanically, I thought.  'It is very delicate of you,' said he, 'but quite needless.  Really, this is the only room in the tower, and no one is there.  At least -'  He left the sentence incomplete, rose, and threw up a window, the only opening in the wall from which the sound seemed to come.  'See.'\n",
      "Not clearly knowing what else to do I followed him to the window and looked out.  A street-lamp some little distance away gave enough light through the murk of the rain that was again falling in torrents to make it entirely plain that 'no one was there.'  In truth there was nothing but the sheer blank wall of the tower.\n",
      "Dampier closed the window and signing me to my seat resumed his own.\n",
      "The incident was not in itself particularly mysterious; any one of a dozen explanations was possible though none has occurred to me, yet it impressed me strangely, the more, perhaps, from my friend's effort to reassure me, which seemed to dignify it with a certain significance and importance.  He had proved that no one was there, but in that fact lay all the interest; and he proffered no explanation.  His silence was irritating and made me resentful.\n",
      "'My good friend,'  I said, somewhat ironically, I fear, 'I am not disposed to question your right to harbor as many spooks as you find agreeable to your taste and consistent with your notions of companionship; that is no business of mine.  But being just a plain man of affairs, mostly of this world, I find spooks needless to my peace and comfort.  I am going to my hotel, where my fellow-guests are still in the flesh.'\n",
      "It was not a very civil speech, but he manifested no feeling about it.  'Kindly remain', he said.  'I am grateful for your presence here.  What you have heard to-night I believe myself to have heard twice before.  Now I know it was no illusion. That is much to me - more than you know.  Have a fresh cigar and a good stock of patience while I tell you the story.'\n",
      "The rain was now falling more steadily, with a low, monotonous susurration, interrupted at long intervals by the sudden slashing of the boughs of the trees as the wind rose and failed.  The night was well advanced, but both sympathy and curiosity held me a willing listener to my friend's monologue, which I did not interrupt by a single word from beginning to end.\n",
      "'Ten years ago,' he said, 'I occupied a ground-floor apartment in one of a row of houses, all alike, away at the other end of the town, on what we call Rincon Hill.  This had been the best quarter of San Francisco, but had fallen into neglect and decay, partly because the primitive character of its domestic architecture no longer suited the maturing tastes of our wealthy citizens, partly because certain public improvements had made a wreck of it.  The row of dwellings in one of which I lived stood a little way back from the street, each having a miniature garden, separated from its neighbors by low iron fences and bisected with mathematical precision by a box-bordered gravel walk from gate to door.\n",
      "'One morning as I was leaving my lodging I observed a young girl entering the adjoining garden on the left.  It was a warm day in June, and she was lightly gowned in white.  From her shoulders hung a broad straw hat profusely decorated with flowers and wonderfully beribboned in the fashion of the time.  My attention was not long held by the exquisite simplicity of her costume, for no one could look at her face and think of anything earthly.  Do not fear; I shall not profane it by description; it was beautiful exceedingly.  All that I had ever seen or dreamed of loveliness was in that matchless living picture by the hand of the Divine Artist.  So deeply did it move me that, without a thought of the impropriety of the act, I unconsciously bared my head, as a devout Catholic or well-bred Protestant uncovers before an image of the Blessed Virgin.  The maiden showed no displeasure; she merely turned her glorious dark eyes upon me with a look that made me catch my breath, and without other recognition of my act passed into the house.  For a moment I stood motionless, hat in hand, painfully conscious of my rudeness, yet so dominated by the emotion inspired by that vision of incomparable beauty that my penitence was less poignant than it should have been.  Then I went my way, leaving my heart behind.  In the natural course of things I should probably have remained away until nightfall, but by the middle of the afternoon I was back in the little garden, affecting an interest in the few foolish flowers that I had never before observed.  My hope was vain; she did not appear.\n",
      "'To a night of unrest succeeded a day of expectation and disappointment, but on the day after, as I wandered aimlessly about the neighborhood, I met her.  Of course I did not repeat my folly of uncovering, nor venture by even so much as too long a look to manifest an interest in her; yet my heart was beating audibly.  I trembled and consciously colored as she turned her big black eyes upon me with a look of obvious recognition entirely devoid of boldness or coquetry.\n",
      "'I will not weary you with particulars; many times afterward I met the maiden, yet never either addressed her or sought to fix her attention.  Nor did I take any action toward making her acquaintance.  Perhaps my forbearance, requiring so supreme an effort of self-denial, will not be entirely clear to you.  That I was heels over head in love is true, but who can overcome his habit of thought, or reconstruct his character?\n",
      "'I was what some foolish persons are pleased to call, and others, more foolish, are pleased to be called - an aristocrat; and despite her beauty, her charms and graces, the girl was not of my class.  I had learned her name - which it is needless to speak - and something of her family.  She was an orphan, a dependent niece of the impossible elderly fat woman in whose lodging-house she lived.  My income was small and I lacked the talent for marrying; it is perhaps a gift.  An alliance with that family would condemn me to its manner of life, part me from my books and studies, and in a social sense reduce me to the ranks.  It is easy to deprecate such considerations as these and I have not retained myself for the defense.  Let judgment be entered against me, but in strict justice all my ancestors for generations should be made co-defendants and I be permitted to plead in mitigation of punishment the imperious mandate of heredity.  To a mÃ©salliance of that kind every globule of my ancestral blood spoke in opposition.  In brief, my tastes, habits, instinct, with whatever of reason my love had left me - all fought against it.  Moreover, I was an irreclaimable sentimentalist, and found a subtle charm in an impersonal and spiritual relation which acquaintance might vulgarize and marriage would certainly dispel.  No woman, I argued, is what this lovely creature seems.  Love is a delicious dream; why should I bring about my own awakening?\n",
      "'The course dictated by all this sense and sentiment was obvious.  Honor, pride, prudence, preservation of my ideals - all commanded me to go away, but for that I was too weak.  The utmost that I could do by a mighty effort of will was to cease meeting the girl, and that I did.  I even avoided the chance encounters of the garden, leaving my lodging only when I knew that she had gone to her music lessons, and returing after nightfall.  Yet all the while I was as one in a trance, indulging the most fascinating fancies and ordering my entire intellectual life in accordance with my dream.  Ah, my friend, as one whose actions have a traceable relation to reason, you cannot know the fool's paradise in which I lived.\n",
      "'One evening the devil put it into my head to be an unspeakable idiot.  By apparently careless and purposeless questioning I learned from my gossipy landlady that the young woman's bedroom adjoined my own, a partywall between.  Yielding to a sudden and coarse impulse I gently rapped on the wall.  There was no response, naturally, but I was in no mood to accept a rebuke.  A madness was upon me and I repeated the folly, the offense, but again ineffectually, and I had the decency to desist.\n",
      "'An hour later, while absorbed in some of my infernal studies, I heard, or thought I heard, my signal answered.  Flinging down my books I sprang to the wall and as steadily as my beating heart would permit gave three slow taps upon it.  This time the response was distinct, unmistakable: one, two, three - an exact repetition of my signal.  That was all I could elicit, but it was enough - too much.\n",
      "'The next evening, and for many evenings afterward, that folly went on, I always having \"the last word\".  During the whole period I was deliriously happy, but with the perversity of my nature I persevered in my resolution not to see her.  Then, as I should have expected, I got no further answers.  \"She is disgusted,\" I said to myself, \"with what she thinks my timidity in making no more definite advances\"; and I resolved to seek her and make her acquaintance and - what?  I did not know, nor do I now know, what might have come of it.  I know only that I passed days and days trying to meet her, and all in vain; she was invisible as well as inaudible.  I haunted the streets where we had met, but she did not come.  From my window I watched the garden in front of her house, but she passed neither in nor out.  I fell into the deepest dejection, believing that she had gone away , yet took no steps to resolve my doubt by inquiry of my landlady, to whom, indeed, I had taken an unconquerable aversion from her having once spoken of the girl with less of reverence than I thought befitting.\n",
      "'There came a fateful night.  Worn out with emotion, irresolution and despondency, I had retired early and fallen into such sleep as was still possible to me.  In the middle of the night something--some malign power bent upon the wrecking of my peace forever--caused me to open my eyes and sit up, wide awake and listening intently for I knew not what.  Then I thought I heard a faint tapping on the wall--the mere ghost of the familiar signal.  In a few moments it was repeated: one, two, three--no louder than before, but addressing a sense alert and strained to receive it.  I was about to reply when the Adversary of Peace again intervened in my affairs with a rascally suggestion of retaliation.  She had long and cruelly ignored me; now I would ignore her.  Incredible fatuity--may God forgive it!  All the rest of the night I lay awake, fortifying my obstinacy with shameless justifications and--listening.\n",
      "'Late the next morning, as I was leaving the house, I met my landlady, entering.\n",
      "' \"Good morning, Mr. Dampier,\" she said.  \"Have you heard the news?\"\n",
      "'I replied in words that I had heard no news; in manner, that I did not care to hear any.  The manner escaped her observation.\n",
      "' \"About the sick young lady next door,\" she babbled on.  \"What!  you did not know? Why, she has been ill for weeks. And now--\"\n",
      "'I almost sprang upon her. \"And now,\" I cried, \"now what?'\n",
      "' \"She is dead.\"\n",
      "'That is not the whole story.  In the middle of the night, as I learned later, the patient, awakening from a long stupor after a week of delirium, had asked -- it was her last utterance -- that her bed be moved to the opposite side of the room.  Those in attendance had thought the request a vagary of her delirium, but had complied.  And there the poor passing soul had exerted its failing will to restore a broken connection -- a golden thread of sentiment between its innocence and a monstrous baseness owing a blind, brutal allegiance to the Law of Self.\n",
      "'What reparation could I make?  Are there masses that can be said for the repose of souls that are abroad such nights as this -- spirits \"blown about by the viewless winds\" -- coming in the storm and darkness with signs and portents, hints of memory and presages of doom?\n",
      "'This is the third visitation.  On the first occasion I was too skeptical to do more than verify by natural methods the character of the incident; on the second, I responded to the signal after it had been several times repeated, but without result. To-night's recurrence completes the 'fatal triad' expounded by Parapelius Necromantius.  There is no more to tell.'\n",
      "When Dampier had finished his story I could think of nothing relevant that I cared to say, and to question him would have been a hideous impertinence.  I rose and bade him good night in a way to convey to him a sense of my sympathy, which he silently acknowledged by a pressure of the hand.  That night, alone with his sorrow and remorse, he passed into the Unknown.\n",

      "One sunny afternoon in the autumn of the year 1861, a soldier lay in a clump of laurel by the side of a road in Western Virginia. He lay at full length, upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head upon the left forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his rifle. But for the somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a slight rhythmic movement of the cartridge-box at the back of his belt, he might have been thought to be dead. He was asleep at his post of duty. But if detected he would be dead shortly afterward, that being the just and legal penalty of his crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clump of laurel in which the criminal lay was in the angle of a road which, after ascending, southward, a steep acclivity to that point, turned sharply to the west, running along the summit for perhaps one hundred yards. There it turned southward again and went zigzagging downward through the forest. At the salient of that second angle was a large flat rock, jutting out from the ridge to the northward, overlooking the deep valley from which the road ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a stone dropped from its outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand feet to the tops of the pines. The angle where the soldier lay was on another spur of the same cliff. Had he been awake he would have commanded a view, not only of the short arm of the road and the jutting rock but of the entire profile of the cliff below it. It might well have made him giddy to look.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country was wooded everywhere except at the bottom of the valley to the northward, where there was a small natural meadow, through which flowed a stream scarcely visible from the valley's rim. This open ground looked hardly larger than an ordinary door-yard, but was really several acres in extent. Its green was more vivid than that of the enclosing forest. Away beyond it rose a line of giant cliffs similar to those upon which we are supposed to stand in our survey of the savage scene, and through which the road had somehow made its climb to the summit. The configuration of the valley, indeed, was such that from out point of observation it seemed entirely shut in, and one could not but have wondered how the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it, and whence came and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the meadow two thousand feet below.\n",
      "\n",
      "No country is so wild and difficult but men will make it a theatre of war; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military rat-trap, in which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have starved an army to submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry. They had marched all the previous day and night and were resting. At nightfall they would take to the road again, climb to the place where their unfaithful sentinel now slept, and, descending the other slope of the ridge, fall upon a camp of the enemy at about midnight. Their hope was to surprise it, for the road led to the rear of it. In case of failure their position would be perilous in the extreme; and fail they surely would should accident or vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sleeping sentinel in the clump of laurel was a young Virginian named Carter Druse. He was the son of wealthy parents, an only child, and had known such ease and cultivation and high living as wealth and taste were able to command in the mountain country of Western Virginia. His home was but a few miles from where he now lay. One morning he had risen from the breakfast table and said, quietly and gravely: \"Father, a Union regiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The father lifted his leonine head, looked at the son a moment in silence, and replied: \"Go, Carter, and, whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get on without you. Should we both live to the end of the war, we will speak further of the matter. Your mother, as the physician has informed you, is in a most critical condition; at the best she cannot be with us longer than a few weeks, but that time is precious. It would be better not to disturb her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Carter Druse, bowing reverently to his father, who returned the salute with a stately courtesy which masked a breaking heart, left the home of his childhood to go soldiering. By conscience and courage, by deeds of devotion and daring, he soon commended himself to his fellows and his officers; and it was to these qualities and to some knowledge of the country that he owed his selection for his present perilous duty at the extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger than resolution, and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a dream to rouse him from his state of crime who shall say? Without a movement, without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of the late afternoon, some invisible messenger of fate touched with unsealing finger the eyes of his consciousness--whispered into the ear of his spirit the mysterious awakening word which no human lips have ever spoken, no human memory ever has recalled. He quietly raised his forehead from his arm and looked between the masking stems of the laurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of his rifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first feeling was a keen artistic delight. On a colossal pedestal, the cliff, motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and sharply outlined against the sky, was an equestrian statue of impressive dignity. The figure of the man sat the figure of the horse, straight and soldierly, but with the repose of a Grecian god carved in the marble which limits the suggestion of activity. The grey costume harmonised with its aerial background; the metal of accoutrement and caparison was softened and subdued by the shadow; the animal's skin had no points of high light. A carbine, strikingly foreshortened, lay across the pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the right hand grasping it at the \"grip\"; the left hand, holding the bridle rein, was invisible. In silhouette against the sky, the profile of the horse was cut with the sharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the confronting cliffs beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly to the left, showed only an outline of temple and beard; he was looking downward to the bottom of the valley. Magnified by its lift against the sky and by the soldier's testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy, the group appeared of heroic, almost colossal, size.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant Druse had a strange, half-defined feeling that he had slept to the end of the war and was looking upon a noble work of art reared upon that commanding eminence to commemorate the deeds of an heroic past of which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was dispelled by a slight movement of the group; the horse, without moving its feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek by cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the piece, and, glancing through the sights, covered a vital spot of the horseman's breast. A touch upon the trigger and all would have been well with Carter Druse. At that instant the horseman turned his head and looked in the direction of his concealed foeman--seemed to look into his very face, into his eyes, into his brave compassionate heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it, then, so terrible to kill an enemy in war--an enemy who has surprised a secret vital to the safety of oneself and comrades--an enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its numbers? Carter Druse grew deathly pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint, and saw the statuesque group before him as black figures, rising, falling, moving unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand fell away from his weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested on the leaves in which he lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy soldier was near swooning from intensity of emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not for long; in another moment his face was raised from earth, his hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger sought the trigger; mind, heart, and eyes were clear, conscience and reason sound. He could not hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him dashing to his camp with his fatal news. The duty of the soldier was plain: the man must be shot dead from ambush--without warning, without a moment's spiritual preparation, with never so much as an unspoken prayer, he must be sent to his account. But no--there is a hope; he may have discovered nothing--perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the landscape. If permitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the direction whence he came. Surely it will be possible to judge at the instant of his withdrawing whether he knows. It may well be that his fixity of attention--Druse turned his head and looked below, through the deeps of air downward, as from the surface to the bottom of a translucent sea. He saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous line of figures of men and horses--some foolish commander was permitting the soldiers of his escort to water their beasts in the open, in plain view from a hundred summits!\n",
      "\n",
      "Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again upon the group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights of his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as if they were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their parting: \"Whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty.\" He was calm now. His teeth were firmly but not rigidly closed; his nerves were as tranquil as a sleeping babe's--not a tremor affected any muscle of his body; his breathing, until suspended in the act of taking aim, was regular and slow. Duty had conquered; the spirit had said to the body: \"Peace, be still.\" He fired.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment an officer of the Federal force, who, in a spirit of adventure or in quest of knowledge, had left the hidden bivouac in the valley, and, with aimless feet, had made his way to the lower edge of a small open space near the foot of the cliff, was considering what he had to gain by pushing his exploration farther. At a distance of a quarter-mile before him, but apparently at a stone's-throw, rose from its fringe of pines the gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a height above him that it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a sharp, rugged line against the sky. At some distance away to his right it presented a clean, vertical profile against a background of blue sky to a point half of the way down, and of distant hills hardly less blue thence to the tops of the trees at its base. Lifting his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit, the officer saw an astonishing sight--a man on horseback riding down into the valley through the air!\n",
      "\n",
      "Straight upright sat the rider, in military fashion, with a firm seat in the saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too impetuous a plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward, waving like a plume. His right hand was concealed in the cloud of the horse's lifted mane. The animal's body was as level as if every hoof-stroke encountered the resistant earth. Its motions were those of a wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they ceased, with all the legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting from a leap. But this was a flight!\n",
      "\n",
      "Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo, and all was still.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together, he ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point a half-mile from its foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvellous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of march of aerial cavalry is directed downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition, he answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the southward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The commander, knowing better, smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "After firing his shot Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you fire?\" the sergeant whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having answered, he turned away his face and said no more. The sergeant did not understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here, Druse,\" he said, after a moment's silence, \"it's no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. \"Good God!\" he said.\n",

      "A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking\n",
      "down into the swift water twenty feet below. The man's hands were\n",
      "behind his back, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely\n",
      "encircled his neck. It was attached to a stout cross-timber above\n",
      "his head and the slack fell to the level of his knees. Some loose\n",
      "boards laid upon the sleepers supporting the metals of the railway\n",
      "supplied a footing for him and his executioners--two private\n",
      "soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil\n",
      "life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short remove upon the\n",
      "same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank,\n",
      "armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the bridge stood\n",
      "with his rifle in the position known as \"support,\" that is to say,\n",
      "vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the\n",
      "forearm thrown straight across the chest--a formal and unnatural\n",
      "position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not\n",
      "appear to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring\n",
      "at the center of the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of\n",
      "the foot planking that traversed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\tBeyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran\n",
      "straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was\n",
      "lost to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The\n",
      "other bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle acclivity topped\n",
      "with a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with\n",
      "a single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass\n",
      "cannon commanding the bridge. Midway of the slope between the\n",
      "bridge and fort were the spectators--a single company of infantry\n",
      "in line, at \"parade rest,\" the butts of the rifles on the ground,\n",
      "the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder,\n",
      "the hands crossed upon the stock. A lieu tenant stood at the right\n",
      "of the line, the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand\n",
      "resting upon his right. Excepting the group of four at the center\n",
      "of the bridge, not a man moved. The company faced the bridge,\n",
      "staring stonily, motionless. The sentinels, facing the banks of the\n",
      "stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. The captain\n",
      "stood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his\n",
      "subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a dignitary who when he\n",
      "comes announced is to be received with formal manifestations of\n",
      "respect, even by those most familiar with him. In the code of\n",
      "military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about\n",
      "thirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge\n",
      "from his habit, which was that of a planter. His features were\n",
      "good--a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his\n",
      "long, dark hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears\n",
      "to the collar of his well-fitting frock coat. He wore a mustache\n",
      "and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark\n",
      "gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have\n",
      "expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently this was no\n",
      "vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision for\n",
      "hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped\n",
      "aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing.\n",
      "The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself\n",
      "immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace.\n",
      "These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on\n",
      "the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the\n",
      "cross-ties of the bridge. The end upon which the civilian stood\n",
      "almost, but not quite, reached a fourth. This plank had been held\n",
      "in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of\n",
      "the sergeant. At a signal from the former the latter would step\n",
      "aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between\n",
      "two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his judgment as\n",
      "simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor his eyes\n",
      "bandaged. He looked a moment at his \"unsteadfast footing,\" then let\n",
      "his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly\n",
      "beneath his feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention\n",
      "and his eyes followed it down the current. How slowly it appeared\n",
      "to move, What a sluggish stream!\n",
      "\n",
      "He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife\n",
      "and children. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the\n",
      "brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream,\n",
      "the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him.\n",
      "And now he became conscious of a new disturbance. Striking through\n",
      "the thought of his dear ones was a sound which he could neither\n",
      "ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like\n",
      "the stroke of a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; it had the same\n",
      "ringing quality. He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably\n",
      "distant or near by--it seemed both. Its recurrence was regular, but\n",
      "as slow as the tolling of a death knell. He awaited each stroke\n",
      "with impatience and--he knew not why--apprehension. The intervals\n",
      "of silence grew progressively longer, the delays became maddening.\n",
      "With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and\n",
      "sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared\n",
      "he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. \"If I could\n",
      "free my hands,\" he thought, \"I might throw off the noose and spring\n",
      "into the stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming\n",
      "vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My\n",
      "home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little\n",
      "ones are still beyond the invader's farthest advance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were\n",
      "flashed into the doomed man's brain rather than evolved from it the\n",
      "captain nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.\n",

      "Peyton Farquhar was a well-to-do planter, of an old and highly\n",
      "respected Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave\n",
      "owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and\n",
      "ardently devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an\n",
      "imperious nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had\n",
      "prevented him from taking service with the gallant army that had\n",
      "fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth,\n",
      "and he chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the\n",
      "release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the\n",
      "opportunity for distinction. That opportunity, he felt, would come,\n",
      "as it comes to all in war time. Meanwhile he did what he could. No\n",
      "service was too humble for him to perform in aid of the South, no\n",
      "adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the\n",
      "character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good\n",
      "faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a\n",
      "part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and\n",
      "war.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic\n",
      "bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up\n",
      "to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only\n",
      "toe, happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was\n",
      "fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and\n",
      "inquired eagerly for news from the front.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Yanks are repairing the railroads,\" said the man, \"and are\n",
      "getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek\n",
      "bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The\n",
      "commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere,\n",
      "declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad,\n",
      "its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the\n",
      "order.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\" Farquhar asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About thirty miles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there no force on this side the creek?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single\n",
      "sentinel at this end of the bridge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the\n",
      "picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\" said\n",
      "Farquhar, smiling, \"what could he accomplish?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier reflected. \"I was there a month ago,\" he replied. \"I\n",
      "observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity\n",
      "of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It\n",
      "is now dry and would burn like tow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He\n",
      "thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An\n",
      "hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going\n",
      "northward in the direction from which he had come. He was a Federal\n",
      "scout.\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he\n",
      "lost consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he\n",
      "was awakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp\n",
      "pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen,\n",
      "poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through\n",
      "every fiber of his body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash\n",
      "along well-defined lines of ramification and to beat with an\n",
      "inconceivably rapid periodicity. They seemed like streams of\n",
      "pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature. As to his\n",
      "head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fulness--of\n",
      "congestion. These sensations were unaccompanied by thought. The\n",
      "intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power\n",
      "only to feel, and feeling was torment. He was conscious of motion.\n",
      "Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the\n",
      "fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through\n",
      "unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all at\n",
      "once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward\n",
      "with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his\n",
      "ears, and all was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored;\n",
      "he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream.\n",
      "There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was\n",
      "already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die\n",
      "of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea seemed to him\n",
      "ludicrous. He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a\n",
      "gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! He was still\n",
      "sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a\n",
      "mere glimmer. Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that\n",
      "he was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he\n",
      "was now very comfortable. \"To be hanged and drowned,\" he thought?\n",
      "\"that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot. No; I will not\n",
      "be shot; that is not fair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist\n",
      "apprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the\n",
      "struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a\n",
      "juggler, without interest in the outcome. What splendid\n",
      "effort!--what magnificent, what superhuman strength! Ah, that was\n",
      "a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell away; his arms parted and\n",
      "floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing\n",
      "light. He watched them with a new interest as first one and then\n",
      "the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it away and\n",
      "thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a\n",
      "water snake. \"Put it back, put it back!\" He thought he shouted\n",
      "these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been\n",
      "succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck\n",
      "ached horribly; his brain was on fire; his heart, which had been\n",
      "fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out\n",
      "at his mouth. His whole body was racked and wrenched with an\n",
      "insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed to\n",
      "the command. They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward\n",
      "strokes, forcing him to the surface. He felt his head emerge; his\n",
      "eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively,\n",
      "and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great\n",
      "draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!\n",
      "\n",
      "He was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were,\n",
      "indeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful\n",
      "disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them\n",
      "that they made record of things never before perceived. He felt the\n",
      "ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they\n",
      "struck. He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the\n",
      "individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--saw the\n",
      "very insects upon them: the locusts, the brilliant-bodied flies,\n",
      "the grey spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig. He noted\n",
      "the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of\n",
      "grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the\n",
      "stream, the beating of the dragon flies' wings, the strokes of the\n",
      "water-spiders' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all\n",
      "these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he\n",
      "heard the rush of its body parting the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the\n",
      "visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal\n",
      "point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the\n",
      "bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his\n",
      "executioners. They were in silhouette against the blue sky. They\n",
      "shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him. The captain had drawn\n",
      "his pistol, but did not fire; the others were unarmed. Their\n",
      "movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water\n",
      "smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with\n",
      "spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with\n",
      "his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from\n",
      "the muzzle. The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the\n",
      "bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle. He\n",
      "observed that it was a grey eye and remembered having read that\n",
      "grey eyes were keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them.\n",
      "Nevertheless, this one had missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he\n",
      "was again looking into the forest on the bank opposite the fort.\n",
      "The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang\n",
      "out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that\n",
      "pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the\n",
      "ripples in his ears. Although no soldier, he had frequented camps\n",
      "enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling,\n",
      "aspirated chant; the lieu. tenant on shore was taking a part in the\n",
      "morning's work. How coldly and pitilessly--with what an even, calm\n",
      "intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquillity in the men--with\n",
      "what accurately measured inter vals fell those cruel words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Attention, company! . . Shoulder arms! . . . Ready! . . . Aim! .\n",
      ". . Fire!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Farquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in\n",
      "his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dulled thunder\n",
      "of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining\n",
      "bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward.\n",
      "Some of them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away,\n",
      "continuing their descent. One lodged between his collar and neck;\n",
      "it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had\n",
      "been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther down\n",
      "stream nearer to safety. The soldiers had almost finished\n",
      "reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as\n",
      "they were drawn from the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust\n",
      "into their sockets. The two sentinels fired again, independently\n",
      "and ineffectually.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming\n",
      "vigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms\n",
      "and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer,\" he reasoned, \"will not make that martinet's error a\n",
      "second time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He\n",
      "has probably already given the command to fire at will. God help\n",
      "me, I cannot dodge them all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An appalling plash within two yards of him was followed by a loud,\n",
      "rushing sound, diminuendo, which seemed to travel back through the\n",
      "air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very\n",
      "river to its deeps!\n",
      "\n",
      "A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him,\n",
      "blinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken a hand in the\n",
      "game. As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten\n",
      "water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead,\n",
      "and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the\n",
      "forest beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They will not do that again,\" he thought; \"the next time they will\n",
      "use a charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke\n",
      "will apprise me--the report arrives too late; it lags behind the\n",
      "missile. That is a good gun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a\n",
      "top. The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge,\n",
      "fort and men--all were commingled and blurred. Objects were\n",
      "represented by their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of\n",
      "color--that was all he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and was\n",
      "being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made\n",
      "him giddy and sick. In a few moments he was flung upon the gravel\n",
      "at the foot of the left bank of the stream--the southern bank--and\n",
      "behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies. The\n",
      "sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on\n",
      "the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He dug his\n",
      "fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and\n",
      "audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he\n",
      "could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees\n",
      "upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a\n",
      "definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their\n",
      "blooms. A strange, roseate light shone through the spaces among\n",
      "their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of\n",
      "Æolian harps. He had no wish to perfect his escape--was content to\n",
      "remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "A whiz and rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his\n",
      "head roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him\n",
      "a random farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping\n",
      "bank, and plunged into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun.\n",
      "The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in\n",
      "it, not even a woodman's road. He had not known that he lived in so\n",
      "wild a region. There was something uncanny in the revelation.\n",
      "\n",
      "By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famishing. The thought of\n",
      "his wife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which\n",
      "led him in what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide\n",
      "and straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields\n",
      "bordered it, no dwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a\n",
      "dog suggested human habitation. The black bodies of the trees\n",
      "formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in\n",
      "a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. Overhead, as he\n",
      "looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great garden stars\n",
      "looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations. He was\n",
      "sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign\n",
      "significance. The wood on either side was full of singular noises,\n",
      "among which--once, twice, and again--he distinctly heard whispers\n",

      "When I had a house in Sri Lanka, my parents came out one winter\n",
      "to see me. Originally I had felt some qualms about encouraging\n",
      "their visit. Any one of several things--the constant heat, the\n",
      "unaccustomed food and drinking water, even the presence of a\n",
      "leprosy clinic a quarter of a mile from the house might easily\n",
      "have an adverse effect on them in one way or another. But I had\n",
      "underestimated their resilience; they made a greater show of\n",
      "adaptability than I had thought possible, and seemed entirely\n",
      "content with everything. They claimed not to mind the lack of\n",
      "running water in the bathrooms, and regularly praised the curries\n",
      "prepared by Appuhamy, the resident cook. Both of them being in\n",
      "their seventies, they were not tempted by the more distant or\n",
      "inaccessible points of interest. It was enough for them to stay\n",
      "around the house reading, sleeping, taking twilight dips in the\n",
      "ocean, and going on short trips along the coast by hired car. If\n",
      "the driver stopped unexpectedly at a shrine to sacrifice a\n",
      "coconut, they were delighted, and if they came upon a group of\n",
      "elephants lumbering along the road, the car had to be parked some\n",
      "distance up ahead, so that they could watch them approach and\n",
      "file past. They had no interest in taking photographs, and this\n",
      "spared me what is perhaps the most taxing duty of cicerone: the\n",
      "repeated waits while the ritual between man and machine is\n",
      "observed. They were ideal guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colombo, where all the people I knew lives, was less than a\n",
      "hundred miles away. Several times we went up for weekends, which\n",
      "I arranged with friends by telephone beforehand. There we had tea\n",
      "on the wide verandas of certain houses in Cinnamon Gardens, and\n",
      "sat at dinners with professors from the university, Protestant\n",
      "ministers, and assorted members of the government. (Many of the\n",
      "Sinhalese found it strange that I should call my parents by their\n",
      "first names, Dodd and Hannah; several of them inquired if I were\n",
      "actually their son or had been adopted.) These weekends in the\n",
      "city were hot and exhausting, and they were always happy to get\n",
      "back to the house, where they could change into comfortable\n",
      "clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One Sunday not long before they were due to return to America, we\n",
      "decided to take in the horse races at Gintota, where there are\n",
      "also some botanical gardens that Hannah wanted to see. I engaged\n",
      "rooms at the New Oriental in Galle and we had lunch there before\n",
      "setting out.\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, the events were late in starting. It was the\n",
      "spectators, in any case, who were the focus of interest. The\n",
      "phalanx of women in their shot-silk saris moved Hannah to cries\n",
      "of delight. The races themselves were something of a\n",
      "disappointment. As we left the grounds, Dodd said with\n",
      "satisfaction: It'll be good to get back to the hotel and relax.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we were going to the botanical gardens, Hannan reminded him.\n",
      "I'd like to have just a peek at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dodd was not eager. Those places cover a lot of territory, you\n",
      "know, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll look inside and come out again, she promised.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hired car took us to the entrance. Dodd was tired, and as a\n",
      "result was having a certain amount of difficulty in walking. The\n",
      "last year or so I find my legs aren't' always doing exactly what\n",
      "I want 'em to do, he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "You two amble along, Hannah told us. I'll run up ahead and find\n",
      "out if there's anything to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped to look up at a clove tree; its powerful odor filled\n",
      "the air like a gas. When we turned to continue our walk, Hannah\n",
      "was no longer in sight. We went on under the high vegetation,\n",
      "around a curve in the path, looked ahead, and still there was no\n",
      "sign of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does your mother think she's doing? The first thing we know\n",
      "she'll be lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's up ahead somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, at the end of a short lane overhung by twisted lianas, we\n",
      "saw her, partially hidden by the gesticulating figure of a\n",
      "Sinhalese standing next to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's going on? Dodd hastened his steps. Run over there, he told\n",
      "me, and I started ahead, walking fast. Then I saw Hannah's\n",
      "animated smile, and slowed my pace. She and the young man stood\n",
      "in front of a huge bank of brown spider orchids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! I thought we'd lost you, I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at these orchids. Aren't they incredible?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dodd came up, nodded at the young man, and examined the display\n",
      "of flowers. They look to me like skunk cabbage, he declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man broke into wild laughter. Dodd stared at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young man has been telling me the history of the garden,\n",
      "Hannah began hurriedly. About the opposition to it, and how it\n",
      "finally came to be planted. It's interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sinhalese beamed triumphantly. He wore white flannels and a\n",
      "crimson blazer, and his sleek black hair gave off a metallic blue\n",
      "glint in the sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordinarily I steer a determined course away from the anonymous\n",
      "person who tries to engage me in conversation. This time it was\n",
      "too late; encouraged by Hannah, the stranger strolled beside her,\n",
      "back to the main path. Dodd and I exchanged a glance, shrugged,\n",
      "and began to follow along behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere up at the end of the gardens a pavilion had been built\n",
      "under the high rain trees. It had a veranda where a few sarong-\n",
      "draped men reclined in long chairs. The young man stopped\n",
      "walking. Now I invite you to a cold ginger beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Hannah said, at a loss. Well, yes. That would be nice. I'd\n",
      "welcome a chance to sit down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dodd peered at his wristwatch. I'll pass up the beer, but I'll\n",
      "sit and watch you.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat and looked out at the lush greenness. The young man's\n",
      "conversation leapt from one subject to another; he seemed unable\n",
      "to follow any train of thought further than its inception. I put\n",
      "this down as a bad sign, and tried to tell from the inflections\n",
      "of Hannah's voice whether she found him as disconcerting as I\n",
      "did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dodd was not listening. He found the heat of low-country Ceylon\n",
      "oppressive, and it was easy to see that he was tired. Thinking I\n",
      "might cover up the young man's chatter, I turned to Dodd and\n",
      "began to talk about whatever came into my head: the resurgence of\n",
      "mask-making in Ambalangoda, devil-dancing, the high incidence of\n",
      "crime among the fishermen converted to Catholicism. Dodd\n",
      "listened, but did no more than move his head now and then in\n",
      "response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly I heard the young man saying to Hannah: I have just the\n",
      "house for you. A godsend to fill your requirements. Very quiet\n",
      "and protected.\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed. Mercy, no! We're not looking for a house. We're only\n",
      "going to be here a few weeks more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked hard at her, hoping she would take my glance as a\n",
      "warning against going on and mentioning the place where she was\n",
      "staying. The young man was not paying attention, in any case.\n",
      "Quite all right. You are not buying houses. But you should see\n",
      "this house and tell your friends. A superior investment, no doubt\n",
      "about that. Shall I introduce myself, please? Justus Gonzag,\n",
      "called Sonny by friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "His smile, which was not a smile at all, gave me an unpleasant\n",
      "physical sensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come anyway. A five-minute walk, guaranteed. He looked\n",
      "searchingly at Hannah. I intend to give you a book of poems. My\n",
      "own. Autographed for you with your name. That will make me very\n",
      "happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Hannan said, a note of dismay in her voice. Then she braced\n",
      "herself and smiled. That would be lovely. But you understand, we\n",
      "can't stay more than a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a silence. Dodd inquired plaintively: Can't we go in\n",
      "the car, at least?\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible, sir. We are having a very narrow road. Car can't get\n",
      "through. I am arranging in a jiffy. He called out. A waiter came\n",
      "up, and he addressed him in Sinhalese at some length. The man\n",
      "nodded and went inside. Your driver is now bringing your car to\n",
      "this gate. Very close by.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was going a little too far. I asked him how he though anyone\n",
      "was going to know which car was ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "No problem. I was present when you were leaving the Pontiac. Your\n",
      "driver is called Wickramasinghe. Up-country resident, most\n",
      "reliable. Down here people are hopeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "I disliked him more each time he spoke. You're not from around\n",
      "here? I asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, no! I'm a Colombo chap. These people are impossible\n",
      "scoundrels. Every one of the blighters has a knife in his belt,\n",
      "guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the waiter brought the check, he signed it with a rapid\n",
      "flourish and stood up. Shall we be going on to the house, then?\n",
      "\n",
      "No one answered, but all three of us rose and reluctantly moved\n",
      "off with him in the direction of the exit gate. The hired car was\n",
      "there; Mr. Wickramasinghe saluted us from behind the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The afternoon heat had gone, leaving only a pocket here and there\n",
      "beneath the trees where the air was still. Originally the lane\n",
      "where we were walking had been wide enough to admit a bullock-\n",
      "car, but the vegetation encroaching on each side had narrowed it\n",
      "to little more than a footpath.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the lane were two concrete gateposts with no gate\n",
      "between them. We passed through, and went into a large compound\n",
      "bordered on two sides by ruined stables. With the exception of\n",
      "one small ell, the house was entirely hidden by high bushes and\n",
      "flowering trees. As we came to a doorway the young man stopped\n",
      "and turned to us, holding up one finger. No noises here, isn't\n",
      "it? Only birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the hour when the birds begin to awaken from their daytime\n",
      "lethargy. An indeterminate twittering came from the trees. He\n",
      "lowered his finger and turned back to the door. Mornings they are\n",
      "singing. Now not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, it's lovely, Hannah told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He led us through a series of dark empty rooms. Here the _dhobi_\n",
      "was washing the soiled clothing. This is the kitchen, you see?\n",
      "Ceylon style. Only the charcoal. My father was refusing paraffin\n",
      "and gas both. Even in Colombo.\n",
      "\n",
      "We huddled in a short corridor while he opened a door, reached\n",
      "in, and flooded the space inside with blinding light. It was a\n",
      "small room, made to seem still smaller by having given glistening\n",
      "crimson walls and ceiling. Almost all the space was filled by a\n",
      "big bed with a satin coverlet of a slightly darker red. A row of\n",
      "straight-backed chairs stood along one wall. Sit down and be\n",
      "comfy, our host advised us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat, staring at the bed and at the three framed pictures on\n",
      "the wall above its brass-spoked headboard: on the left a girl, in\n",
      "the middle our host, and on the right another young man. The\n",
      "portraits had the imprecision of passport photographs that have\n",
      "been enlarged to many times their original size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah coughed. She had nothing to say. The room gave off a\n",
      "cloying scent of ancient incense, as in a disused chapel. The\n",
      "feeling of absurdity I got from seeing us sitting there side by\n",
      "side, wedged in between the bed and the wall, was so powerful\n",
      "that it briefly paralyzed my mental processes. For once the young\n",
      "man was being silent; he sat stiffly, looking straight ahead,\n",
      "like someone at the theater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally I had to say something. I turned to our host and asked\n",
      "him if he slept in this room. The question seemed to shock him.\n",
      "Here? he cried, as if the thing were inconceivable. No, no! This\n",
      "house is unoccupied. No one sleeping on the premises. Only a\n",
      "stout chap to watch out at night. Excuse me one moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped up and hurried out of the room. We heard his footsteps\n",
      "echo in the corridor and then grow silent. From somewhere in the\n",
      "house there came the sonorous chiming of a grandfather's clock;\n",
      "its comfortable sound made the shiny blood-colored cubicle even\n",
      "more remote and unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dodd stirred uncomfortably in his chair; the bed was too close\n",
      "for him to cross his legs. As soon as he comes back, we go, he\n",
      "muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's looking for the book, I imagine, said Hannah.\n",
      "\n",
      "We waited a while. Then I said: Look. If he's not back in two\n",
      "minutes, I move we just get up and leave. We can find out way out\n",
      "all right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah objected, saying it would be unpardonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again we sat in silence, Dodd now shielding his eyes from the\n",
      "glare. When Sonny Gonzag returned, he was carrying a glass of\n",
      "water which he drank standing in the doorway. His expression had\n",
      "altered: he now looked preoccupied, and he was breathing heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "We slowly got to our feet, Hannah still looking expectant.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are going, then? Come. With the empty glass still in his hand\n",
      "he turned off the lights, shut the door behind us, opened\n",
      "another, and led us quickly through a sumptuous room furnished\n",
      "with large divans, coromandel screens, and bronze Buddhas. We had\n",
      "no time to do more than glance from side to side as we followed\n",
      "him. As we went out through the front door, he called one\n",
      "peremptory word back into the house, presumably to the caretaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a wide unkempt lawn on this side, where a few clumps of\n",
      "high areca palms were being slowly strangled by the sheaths of\n",
      "philodendron roots and leaves that encased their trunks. Creepers\n",
      "had spread themselves unpleasantly over the tops of shrubs like\n",
      "the meshes of gigantic cobwebs. I knew that Hannah was thinking\n",
      "of snakes. She kept her eyes on the ground, stepping carefully\n",
      "from flagstone to flagstone as we followed the exterior of the\n",
      "house around to the stables, and thence out into the lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "The swift twilight had come down. No one seemed disposed to\n",
      "speak. When we reached the car Mr. Wickramasinghe stood beside\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheery-bye, then, and tell your friends to look for Sonny Gonzag\n",
      "when they are coming to Gintota. He offered his hand to Dodd\n",
      "first, then me, finally to Hannah, and turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were both very quiet on the way back to Galle. The road was\n",
      "narrow and the blinding lights of oncoming cars made them\n",
      "nervous. During dinner we made no mention of the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "At breakfast, on the veranda swept by the morning breeze, we felt\n",
      "sufficiently removed from the experience to discuss it. Hannah\n",
      "said: I kept waking up in the night and seeing that awful bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dodd groaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said it was like watching television without the sound. You saw\n",
      "everything, but you didn't get what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kid was completely non compos mentis. You could see that a\n",
      "mile away, Dodd declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah was not listening. It must have been a maid's room. But\n",
      "why would he take us there? I don't know; there's something\n",
      "terribly depressing about the whole thing. It makes me feel a\n",
      "little sick just to think about it. And that bed!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, stop thinking about it, then! Dodd told her. I for one am\n",
      "going to put it right out of my mind. He waited. I feel better\n",
      "already. Isn't that the way the Buddhists do it?\n",
      "\n",
      "The sunny holiday continued for a few weeks more, with longer\n",
      "trips now to the east, to Tissamaharana and the wild elephants in\n",
      "the Yala Preserve. We did not go to Colombo again until it was\n",
      "time for me to put them onto the plane.\n",
      "\n",
      "The black weather of the monsoons was blowing in from the\n",
      "southwest as we drove up the coast. There was a violent downpour\n",
      "when we arrived in midafternoon at Mount Lavinia and checked into\n",
      "our rooms. The crashing of the waves outside my room was so loud\n",

      "\tA Study in Temperament\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Paul's afternoon to appear before the faculty of the Pittsburgh High School to account for his various misdemeanors. He had been suspended a week ago, and his father had called at the Principal's office and confessed his perplexity about his son. Paul entered the faculty room suave and smiling. His clothes were a trifle outgrown, and the tan velvet on the collar of his open overcoat was frayed and worn; but for all that there was something of the dandy about him, and he wore an opal pin in his neatly knotted black four-in-hand, and a red carnation in his buttonhole. This latter adornment the faculty somehow felt was not properly significant of the contrite spirit befitting a boy under the ban of suspension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul was tall for his age and very thin, with high, cramped shoulders and a narrow chest. His eyes were remarkable for a certain hysterical brilliancy, and he continually used them in a conscious, theatrical sort of way, peculiarly offensive in a boy. The pupils were abnormally large, as though he were addicted to belladonna, but there was a glassy glitter about them which that drug does not produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "When questioned by the Principal as to why he was there Paul stated, politely enough, that he wanted to come back to school. This was a lie, but Paul was quite accustomed to lying; found it, indeed, indispensable for overcoming friction. His teachers were asked to state their respective charges against him, which they did with such a rancor and aggrievedness as evinced that this was not a usual case. Disorder and impertinence were among the offenses named, yet each of his instructors felt that it was scarcely possible to put into words the real cause of the trouble, which lay in a sort of hysterically defiant manner of the boy's; in the contempt which they all knew he felt for them, and which he seemingly made not the least effort to conceal. Once, when he had been making a synopsis of a paragraph at the blackboard, his English teacher had stepped to his side and attempted to guide his hand. Paul had started back with a shudder and thrust his hands violently behind him. The astonished woman could scarcely have been more hurt and embarrassed had he struck at her. The insult was so involuntary and definitely personal as to be unforgettable. In one way and another he had made all his teachers, men and women alike, conscious of the same feeling of physical aversion. In one class he habitually sat with his hand shading his eyes; in another he always looked out of the window during the recitation; in another he made a running commentary on the lecture, with humorous intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "His teachers felt this afternoon that his whole attitude was symbolized by his shrug and his flippantly red carnation flower, and they fell upon him without mercy, his English teacher leading the pack. He stood through it smiling, his pale lips parted over his white teeth. (His lips were continually twitching, and be had a habit of raising his eyebrows that was contemptuous and irritating to the last degree.) Older boys than Paul had broken down and shed tears under that baptism of fire, but his set smile did not once desert him, and his only sign of discomfort was the nervous trembling of the fingers that toyed with the buttons of his overcoat, and an occasional jerking of the other hand that held his hat. Paul was always smiling, always glancing about him, seeming to feel that people might be watching him and trying to detect something. This conscious expression, since it was as far as possible from boyish mirthfulness, was usually attributed to insolence or \"smartness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the inquisition proceeded one of his instructors repeated an impertinent remark of the boy's, and the Principal asked him whether he thought that a courteous speech to have made a woman. Paul shrugged his shoulders slightly and his eyebrows twitched.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" he replied. \"I didn't mean to be polite or impolite, either. I guess it's a sort of way I have of saying things regardless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Principal, who was a sympathetic man, asked him whether he didn't think that a way it would be well to get rid of. Paul grinned and said he guessed so. When he was told that he could go he bowed gracefully and went out. His bow was but a repetition of the scandalous red carnation.\n",
      "\n",
      "His teachers were in despair, and his drawing master voiced the feeling of them all when he declared there was something about the boy which none of them understood. He added: \"I don't really believe that smile of his comes altogether from insolence; there's something sort of haunted about it. The boy is not strong, for one thing. I happen to know that he was born in Colorado, only a few months before his mother died out there of a long illness. There is something wrong about the fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The drawing master had come to realize that, in looking at Paul, one saw only his white teeth and the forced animation of his eyes. One warm afternoon the boy had gone to sleep at his drawing board, and his master had noted with amazement what a white, blue-veined face it was; drawn and wrinkled like an old man's about the eyes, the lips twitching even in his sleep, and stiff with a nervous tension that drew them back from his teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "His teachers left the building dissatisfied and unhappy; humiliated to have felt so vindictive toward a mere boy, to have uttered this feeling in cutting terms, and to have set each other on, as it were, in the gruesome game of intemperate reproach. Some of them remembered having seen a miserable street cat set at bay by a ring of tormentors.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Paul, he ran down the hill whistling the \"Soldiers' Chorus\" from Faust, looking wildly behind him now and then to see whether some of his teachers were not there to writhe under his lightheartedness. As it was now late in the afternoon and Paul was on duty that evening as usher at Carnegie Hall, he decided that he would not go home to supper. When he reached the concert hall the doors were not yet open and, as it was chilly outside, he decided to go up into the picture gallery--always deserted at this hour--where there were some of Raffelli's gay studies of Paris streets and an airy blue Venetian scene or two that always exhilarated him. He was delighted to find no one in the gallery but the old guard, who sat in one corner, a newspaper on his knee, a black patch over one eye and the other closed. Paul possessed himself of the peace and walked confidently up and down, whistling under his breath. After a while he sat down before a blue Rico and lost himself. When he bethought him to look at his watch, it was after seven o'clock, and he rose with a start and ran downstairs, making a face at Augustus, peering out from the cast room, and an evil gesture at the Venus de Milo as he passed her on the stairway.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Paul reached the ushers' dressing room half a dozen boys were there already, and he began excitedly to tumble into his uniform. It was one of the few that at all approached fitting, and Paul thought it very becoming-though he knew that the tight, straight coat accentuated his narrow chest, about which he was exceedingly sensitive. He was always considerably excited while be dressed, twanging all over to the tuning of the strings and the preliminary flourishes of the horns in the music room; but tonight he seemed quite beside himself, and he teased and plagued the boys until, telling him that he was crazy, they put him down on the floor and sat on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhat calmed by his suppression, Paul dashed out to the front of the house to seat the early comers. He was a model usher; gracious and smiling he ran up and down the aisles; nothing was too much trouble for him; he carried messages and brought programs as though it were his greatest pleasure in life, and all the people in his section thought him a charming boy, feeling that he remembered and admired them. As the house filled, he grew more and more vivacious and animated, and the color came to his cheeks and lips. It was very much as though this were a great reception and Paul were the host. just as the musicians came out to take their places, his English teacher arrived with checks for the seats which a prominent manufacturer had taken for the season. She betrayed some embarrassment when she handed Paul the tickets, and a hauteur which subsequently made her feel very foolish. Paul was startled for a moment, and had the feeling of wanting to put her out; what business had she here among all these fine people and gay colors? He looked her over and decided that she was not appropriately dressed and must be a fool to sit downstairs in such togs. The tickets had probably been sent her out of kindness, he reflected as he put down a seat for her, and she had about as much right to sit there as he had.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the symphony began Paul sank into one of the rear seats with a long sigh of relief, and lost himself as he had done before the Rico. It was not that symphonies, as such, meant anything in particular to Paul, but the first sigh of the instruments seemed to free some hilarious and potent spirit within him; something that struggled there like the genie in the bottle found by the Arab fisherman. He felt a sudden zest of life; the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor. When the soprano soloist came on Paul forgot even the nastiness of his teacher's being there and gave himself up to the peculiar stimulus such personages always had for him. The soloist chanced to be a German woman, by no means in her first youth, and the mother of many children; but she wore an elaborate gown and a tiara, and above all she had that indefinable air of achievement, that world-shine upon her, which, in Paul's eyes, made her a veritable queen of Romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a concert was over Paul was always irritable and wretched until he got to sleep, and tonight he was even more than usually restless. He had the feeling of not being able to let down, of its being impossible to give up this delicious excitement which was the only thing that could be called living at all. During the last number he withdrew and, after hastily changing his clothes in the dressing room, slipped out to the side door where the soprano's carriage stood. Here he began pacing rapidly up and down the walk, waiting to see her come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over yonder, the Schenley, in its vacant stretch, loomed big and square through the fine rain, the windows of its twelve stories glowing like those of a lighted cardboard house under a Christmas tree. All the actors and singers of the better class stayed there when they were in the city, and a number of the big manufacturers of the place lived there in the winter. Paul had often hung about the hotel, watching the people go in and out, longing to enter and leave schoolmasters and dull care behind him forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the singer came out, accompanied by the conductor, who helped her into her carriage and closed the door with a cordial auf wiedersehen which set Paul to wondering whether she were not an old sweetheart of his. Paul followed the carriage over to the hotel, walking so rapidly as not to be far from the entrance when the singer alighted, and disappeared behind the swinging glass doors that were opened by a Negro in a tall hat and a long coat. In the moment that the door was ajar it seemed to Paul that he, too, entered. He seemed to feel himself go after her up the steps, into the warm, lighted building, into an exotic, tropical world of shiny, glistening surfaces and basking ease. He reflected upon the mysterious dishes that were brought into the dining room, the green bottles in buckets of ice, as he had seen them in the supper party pictures of the Sunday World supplement. A quick gust of wind brought the rain down with sudden vehemence, and Paul was startled to find that he was still outside in the slush of the gravel driveway; that his boots were letting in the water and his scanty overcoat was clinging wet about him; that the lights in front of the concert hall were out and that the rain was driving in sheets between him and the orange glow of the windows above him. There it was, what be wanted--tangibly before him, like the fairy world of a Christmas pantomime--but mocking spirits stood guard at the doors, and, as the rain beat in his face, Paul wondered whether he were destined always to shiver in the black night outside, looking up at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned and walked reluctantly toward the car tracks. The end had to come sometime; his father in his nightclothes at the top of the stairs, explanations that did not explain, hastily improvised fictions that were forever tripping him up, his upstairs room and its horrible yellow wallpaper, the creaking bureau with the greasy plush collarbox, and over his painted wooden bed the pictures of George Washington and John Calvin, and the framed motto, \"Feed my Lambs,\" which had been worked in red worsted by his mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Half an hour later Paul alighted from his car and went slowly down one of the side streets off the main thoroughfare. It was a highly respectable street, where all the houses were exactly alike, and where businessmen of moderate means begot and reared large families of children, all of whom went to Sabbath school and learned the shorter catechism, and were interested in arithmetic; all of whom were as exactly alike as their homes, and of a piece with the monotony in which they lived. Paul never went up Cordelia Street without a shudder of loathing. His home was next to the house of the Cumberland minister. He approached it tonight with the nerveless sense of defeat, the hopeless feeling of sinking back forever into ugliness and commonness that he had always had when he came home. The moment he turned into Cordelia Street he felt the waters close above his head. After each of these orgies of living he experienced all the physical depression which follows a debauch; the loathing of respectable beds, of common food, of a house penetrated by kitchen odors; a shuddering repulsion for the flavorless, colorless mass of everyday existence; a morbid desire for cool things and soft lights and fresh flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nearer he approached the house, the more absolutely unequal Paul felt to the sight of it all: his ugly sleeping chamber; the cold bathroom with the grimy zinc tub, the cracked mirror, the dripping spiggots; his father, at the top of the stairs, his hairy legs sticking out from his nightshirt, his feet thrust into carpet slippers. He was so much later than usual that there would certainly be inquiries and reproaches. Paul stopped short before the door. He felt that he could not be accosted by his father tonight; that he could not toss again on that miserable bed. He would not go in. He would tell his father that he had no carfare and it was raining so hard he had gone home with one of the boys and stayed all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he was wet and cold. He went around to the back of the house and tried one of the basement windows, found it open, raised it cautiously, and scrambled down the cellar wall to the floor. There he stood, holding his breath, terrified by the noise he had made, but the floor above him was silent, and there was no creak on the stairs. He found a soapbox, and carried it over to the soft ring of light that streamed from the furnace door, and sat down. He was horribly afraid of rats, so he did not try to sleep, but sat looking distrustfully at the dark, still terrified lest he might have awakened his father. In such reactions, after one of the experiences which made days and nights out of the dreary blanks of the calendar, when his senses were deadened, Paul's head was always singularly clear. Suppose his father had heard him getting in at the window and had come down and shot him for a burglar? Then, again, suppose his father had come down, pistol in hand, and he had cried out in time to save himself, and his father had been horrified to think how nearly he had killed him? Then, again, suppose a day should come when his father would remember that night, and wish there had been no warning cry to stay his hand? With this last supposition Paul entertained himself until daybreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following Sunday was fine; the sodden November chill was broken by the last flash of autumnal summer. In the morning Paul had to go to church and Sabbath school, as always. On seasonable Sunday afternoons the burghers of Cordelia Street always sat out on their front stoops and talked to their neighbors on the next stoop, or called to those across the street in neighborly fashion. The men usually sat on gay cushions placed upon the steps that led down to the sidewalk, while the women, in their Sunday \"waists,\" sat in rockers on the cramped porches, pretending to be greatly at their ease. The children played in the streets; there were so many of them that the place resembled the recreation grounds of a kindergarten. The men on the steps--all in their shirt sleeves, their vests unbuttoned--sat with their legs well apart, their stomachs comfortably protruding, and talked of the prices of things, or told anecdotes of the sagacity of their various chiefs and overlords. They occasionally looked over the multitude of squabbling children, listened affectionately to their high-pitched, nasal voices, smiling to see their own proclivities reproduced in their offspring, and interspersed their legends of the iron kings with remarks about their sons' progress at school, their grades in arithmetic, and the amounts they had saved in their toy banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this last Sunday of November Paul sat all the afternoon on the lowest step of his stoop, staring into the street, while his sisters, in their rockers, were talking to the minister's daughters next door about how many shirtwaists they had made in the last week, and bow many waffles someone had eaten at the last church supper. When the weather was warm, and his father was in a particularly jovial frame of mind, the girls made lemonade, which was always brought out in a red-glass pitcher, ornamented with forget-me-nots in blue enamel. This the girls thought very fine, and the neighbors always joked about the suspicious color of the pitcher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today Paul's father sat on the top step, talking to a young man who shifted a restless baby from knee to knee. He happened to be the young man who was daily held up to Paul as a model, and after whom it was his father's dearest hope that he would pattern. This young man was of a ruddy complexion, with a compressed, red mouth, and faded, nearsighted eyes, over which he wore thick spectacles, with gold bows that curved about his ears. He was clerk to one of the magnates of a great steel corporation, and was looked upon in Cordelia Street as a young man with a future. There was a story that, some five years ago--he was now barely twenty-six--he had been a trifle dissipated, but in order to curb his appetites and save the loss of time and strength that a sowing of wild oats might have entailed, he had taken his chief's advice, oft reiterated to his employees, and at twenty- one had married the first woman whom he could persuade to share his fortunes. She happened to be an angular schoolmistress, much older than he, who also wore thick glasses, and who had now borne him four children, all nearsighted, like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man was relating how his chief, now cruising in the Mediterranean, kept in touch with all the details of the business, arranging his office hours on his yacht just as though he were at home, and \"knocking off work enough to keep two stenographers busy.\" His father told, in turn, the plan his corporation was considering, of putting in an electric railway plant in Cairo. Paul snapped his teeth; he had an awful apprehension that they might spoil it all before he got there. Yet he rather liked to hear these legends of the iron kings that were told and retold on Sundays and holidays; these stories of palaces in Venice, yachts on the Mediterranean, and high play at Monte Carlo appealed to his fancy, and he was interested in the triumphs of these cash boys who had become famous, though he had no mind for the cash-boy stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper was over and he had helped to dry the dishes, Paul nervously asked his father whether he could go to George's to get some help in his geometry, and still more nervously asked for carfare. This latter request he had to repeat, as his father, on principle, did not like to hear requests for money, whether much or little. He asked Paul whether he could not go to some boy who lived nearer, and told him that he ought not to leave his schoolwork until Sunday; but he gave him the dime. He was not a poor man, but he had a worthy ambition to come up in the world. His only reason for allowing Paul to usher was that he thought a boy ought to be earning a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul bounded upstairs, scrubbed the greasy odor of the dishwater from his hands with the ill-smelling soap he hated, and then shook over his fingers a few drops of violet water from the bottle he kept hidden in his drawer. He left the house with his geometry conspicuously under his arm, and the moment he got out of Cordelia Street and boarded a downtown car, he shook off the lethargy of two deadening days and began to live again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leading juvenile of the permanent stock company which played at one of the downtown theaters was an acquaintance of Paul's, and the boy had been invited to drop in at the Sunday-night rehearsals whenever he could. For more than a year Paul had spent every available moment loitering about Charley Edwards's dressing room. He had won a place among Edwards's following not only because the young actor, who could not afford to employ a dresser, often found him useful, but because he recognized in Paul something akin to what churchmen term \"vocation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at the theater and at Carnegie Hall that Paul really lived; the rest was but a sleep and a forgetting. This was Paul's fairy tale, and it had for him all the allurement of a secret love. The moment he inhaled the gassy, painty, dusty odor behind the scenes, he breathed like a prisoner set free, and felt within him the possibility of doing or saying splendid, brilliant, poetic things. The moment the cracked orchestra beat out the overture from Martha, or jerked at the serenade from Rigoletto, all stupid and ugly things slid from him, and his senses were deliciously, yet delicately fired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it was because, in Paul's world, the natural nearly always wore the guise of ugliness, that a certain element of artificiality seemed to him necessary in beauty. Perhaps it was because his experience of life elsewhere was so full of Sabbath- school picnics, petty economies, wholesome advice as to how to succeed in life, and the inescapable odors of cooking, that he found this existence so alluring, these smartly clad men and women so attractive, that he was so moved by these starry apple orchards that bloomed perennially under the limelight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be difficult to put it strongly enough how convincingly the stage entrance of that theater was for Paul the actual portal of Romance. Certainly none of the company ever suspected it, least of all Charley Edwards. It was very like the old stories that used to float about London of fabulously rich Jews, who had subterranean halls there, with palms, and fountains, and soft lamps and richly appareled women who never saw the disenchanting light of London day. So, in the midst of that smoke-palled city, enamored of figures and grimy toil, Paul had his secret temple, his wishing carpet, his bit of blue-and- white Mediterranean shore bathed in perpetual sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several of Paul's teachers had a theory that his imagination had been perverted by garish fiction, but the truth was that he scarcely ever read at all. The books at home were not such as would either tempt or corrupt a youthful mind, and as for reading the novels that some of his friends urged upon him--well, he got what he wanted much more quickly from music; any sort of music, from an orchestra to a barrel organ. He needed only the spark, the indescribable thrill that made his imagination master of his senses, and he could make plots and pictures enough of his own. It was equally true that he was not stagestruck-not, at any rate, in the usual acceptation of that expression. He had no desire to become an actor, any more than he had to become a musician. He felt no necessity to do any of these things; what he wanted was to see, to be in the atmosphere, float on the wave of it, to be carried out, blue league after blue league, away from everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a night behind the scenes Paul found the schoolroom more than ever repulsive; the bare floors and naked walls; the prosy men who never wore frock coats, or violets in their buttonholes; the women with their dull gowns, shrill voices, and pitiful seriousness about prepositions that govern the dative. He could not bear to have the other pupils think, for a moment, that he took these people seriously; he must convey to them that he considered it all trivial, and was there only by way of a jest, anyway. He had autographed pictures of all the members of the stock company which he showed his classmates, telling them the most incredible stories of his familiarity with these people, of his acquaintance with the soloists who came to Carnegie Hall, his suppers with them and the flowers he sent them. When these stories lost their effect, and his audience grew listless, he became desperate and would bid all the boys good-by, announcing that he was going to travel for a while; going to Naples, to Venice, to Egypt. Then, next Monday, he would slip back, conscious and nervously smiling; his sister was ill, and he should have to defer his voyage until spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matters went steadily worse with Paul at school. In the itch to let his instructors know how heartily he despised them and their homilies, and how thoroughly he was appreciated elsewhere, he mentioned once or twice that he had no time to fool with theorems; adding--with a twitch of the eyebrows and a touch of that nervous bravado which so perplexed them--that he was helping the people down at the stock company; they were old friends of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "The upshot of the matter was that the Principal went to Paul's father, and Paul was taken out of school and put to work. The manager at Carnegie Hall was told to get another usher in his stead; the doorkeeper at the theater was warned not to admit him to the house; and Charley Edwards remorsefully promised the boy's father not to see him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The members of the stock company were vastly amused when some of Paul's stories reached them--especially the women. They were hardworking women, most of them supporting indigent husbands or brothers, and they laughed rather bitterly at having stirred the boy to such fervid and florid inventions. They agreed with the faculty and with his father that Paul's was a bad case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eastbound train was plowing through a January snowstorm; the dull dawn was beginning to show gray when the engine whistled a mile out of Newark. Paul started up from the seat where he had lain curled in uneasy slumber, rubbed the breath-misted window glass with his hand, and peered out. The snow was whirling in curling eddies above the white bottom lands, and the drifts lay already deep in the fields and along the fences, while here and there the long dead grass and dried weed stalks protruded black above it. Lights shone from the scattered houses, and a gang of laborers who stood beside the track waved their lanterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul had slept very little, and he felt grimy and uncomfortable. He had made the all-night journey in a day coach, partly because he was ashamed, dressed as he was, to go into a Pullman, and partly because he was afraid of being seen there by some Pittsburgh businessman, who might have noticed him in Denny & Carson's office. When the whistle awoke him, he clutched quickly at his breast pocket, glancing about him with an uncertain smile. But the little, clay-bespattered Italians were still sleeping, the slatternly women across the aisle were in open-mouthed oblivion, and even the crumby, crying babies were for the nonce stilled. Paul settled back to struggle with his impatience as best he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he arrived at the Jersey City station he hurried through his breakfast, manifestly ill at ease and keeping a sharp eye about him. After he reached the Twenty-third Street station, he consulted a cabman and had himself driven to a men's-furnishings establishment that was just opening for the day. He spent upward of two hours there, buying with endless reconsidering and great care. His new street suit he put on in the fitting room; the frock coat and dress clothes he had bundled into the cab with his linen. Then he drove to a hatter's and a shoe house. His next errand was at Tiffany's, where he selected his silver and a new scarf pin. He would not wait to have his silver marked, he said. Lastly, he stopped at a trunk shop on Broadway and had his purchases packed into various traveling bags.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a little after one o'clock when he drove up to the Waldorf, and after settling with the cabman, went into the office. He registered from Washington; said his mother and father had been abroad, and that he had come down to await the arrival of their steamer. He told his story plausibly and had no trouble, since he volunteered to pay for them in advance, in engaging his rooms; a sleeping room, sitting room, and bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not once, but a hundred times, Paul had planned this entry into New York. He had gone over every detail of it with Charley Edwards, and in his scrapbook at home there were pages of description about New York hotels, cut from the Sunday papers. When he was shown to his sitting room on the eighth floor he saw at a glance that everything was as it should be; there was but one detail in his mental picture that the place did not realize, so he rang for the bellboy and sent him down for flowers. He moved about nervously until the boy returned, putting away his new linen and fingering it delightedly as he did so. When the flowers came he put them hastily into water, and then tumbled into a hot bath. Presently he came out of his white bathroom, resplendent in his new silk underwear, and playing with the tassels of his red robe. The snow was whirling so fiercely outside his windows that he could scarcely see across the street, but within the air was deliciously soft and fragrant. He put the violets and jonquils on the taboret beside the couch, and threw himself down, with a long sigh, covering himself with a Roman blanket. He was thoroughly tired; he had been in such haste, he had stood up to such a strain, covered so much ground in the last twenty-four hours, that he wanted to think how it had all come about. Lulled by the sound of the wind, the warm air, and the cool fragrance of the flowers, he sank into deep, drowsy retrospection.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been wonderfully simple; when they had shut him out of the theater and concert hall, when they had taken away his bone, the whole thing was virtually determined. The rest was a mere matter of opportunity. The only thing that at all surprised him was his own courage-for he realized well enough that he had always been tormented by fear, a sort of apprehensive dread that, of late years, as the meshes of the lies he had told closed about him, had been pulling the muscles of his body tighter and tighter. Until now he could not remember the time when he had not been dreading something. Even when he was a little boy it was always there--behind him, or before, or on either side. There had always been the shadowed corner, the dark place into which he dared not look, but from which something seemed always to be watching him--and Paul had done things that were not pretty to watch, he knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now he had a curious sense of relief, as though he had at last thrown down the gauntlet to the thing in the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it was but a day since he had been sulking in the traces; but yesterday afternoon that he had been sent to the bank with Denny & Carson's deposit, as usual--but this time he was instructed to leave the book to be balanced. There was above two thousand dollars in checks, and nearly a thousand in the bank notes which he had taken from the book and quietly transferred to his pocket. At the bank he had made out a new deposit slip. His nerves had been steady enough to permit of his returning to the office, where he had finished his work and asked for a full day's holiday tomorrow, Saturday, giving a perfectly reasonable pretext. The bankbook, he knew, would not be returned before Monday or Tuesday, and his father would be out of town for the next week. From the time he slipped the bank notes into his pocket until he boarded the night train for New York, he had not known a moment's hesitation. It was not the first time Paul had steered through treacherous waters.\n",
      "\n",
      "How astonishingly easy it had all been; here he was, the thing done; and this time there would be no awakening, no figure at the top of the stairs. He watched the snowflakes whirling by his window until he fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he awoke, it was three o'clock in the afternoon. He bounded up with a start; half of one of his precious days gone already! He spent more than an hour in dressing, watching every stage of his toilet carefully in the mirror. Everything was quite perfect; he was exactly the kind of boy he had always wanted to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he went downstairs Paul took a carriage and drove up Fifth Avenue toward the Park. The snow had somewhat abated; carriages and tradesmen's wagons were hurrying soundlessly to and fro in the winter twilight; boys in woolen mufflers were shoveling off the doorsteps; the avenue stages made fine spots of color against the white street. Here and there on the corners were stands, with whole flower gardens blooming under glass cases, against the sides of which the snowflakes stuck and melted; violets, roses, carnations, lilies of the valley--somehow vastly more lovely and alluring that they blossomed thus unnaturally in the snow. The Park itself was a wonderful stage winterpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he returned, the pause of the twilight had ceased and the tune of the streets had changed. The snow was falling faster, lights streamed from the hotels that reared their dozen stories fearlessly up into the storm, defying the raging Atlantic winds. A long, black stream of carriages poured down the avenue, intersected here and there by other streams, tending horizontally. There were a score of cabs about the entrance of his hotel, and his driver had to wait. Boys in livery were running in and out of the awning stretched across the sidewalk, up and down the red velvet carpet laid from the door to the street. Above, about, within it all was the rumble and roar, the hurry and toss of thousands of human beings as hot for pleasure as himself, and on every side of him towered the glaring affirmation of the omnipotence of wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy set his teeth and drew his shoulders together in a spasm of realization; the plot of all dramas, the text of all romances, the nerve-stuff of all sensations was whirling about him like the snowflakes. He burnt like a faggot in a tempest.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Paul went down to dinner the music of the orchestra came floating up the elevator shaft to greet him. His head whirled as he stepped into the thronged corridor, and he sank back into one of the chairs against the wall to get his breath. The lights, the chatter, the perfumes, the bewildering medley of color--he had, for a moment, the feeling of not being able to stand it. But only for a moment; these were his own people, he told himself. He went slowly about the corridors, through the writing rooms, smoking rooms, reception rooms, as though he were exploring the chambers of an enchanted palace, built and peopled for him alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the dining room he sat down at a table near a window. The flowers, the white linen, the many-colored wineglasses, the gay toilettes of the women, the low popping of corks, the undulating repetitions of the Blue Danube from the orchestra, all flooded Paul's dream with bewildering radiance. When the roseate tinge of his champagne was added--that cold, precious, bubbling stuff that creamed and foamed in his glass-- Paul wondered that there were honest men in the world at all. This was what all the world was fighting for, he reflected; this was what all the struggle was about. He doubted the reality of his past. Had he ever known a place called Cordelia Street, a place where fagged-looking businessmen got on the early car; mere rivets in a machine they seemed to Paul,--sickening men, with combings of children's hair always hanging to their coats, and the smell of cooking in their clothes. Cordelia Street--Ah, that belonged to another time and country; had he not always been thus, had he not sat here night after night, from as far back as he could remember, looking pensively over just such shimmering textures and slowly twirling the stem of a glass like this one between his thumb and middle finger? He rather thought he had.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not in the least abashed or lonely. He had no especial desire to meet or to know any of these people; all he demanded was the right to look on and conjecture, to watch the pageant. The mere stage properties were all he contended for. Nor was he lonely later in the evening, in his lodge at the Metropolitan. He was now entirely rid of his nervous misgivings, of his forced aggressiveness, of the imperative desire to show himself different from his surroundings. He felt now that his surroundings explained him. Nobody questioned the purple; he had only to wear it passively. He had only to glance down at his attire to reassure himself that here it would be impossible for anyone to humiliate him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found it hard to leave his beautiful sitting room to go to bed that night, and sat long watching the raging storm from his turret window. When he went to sleep it was with the lights turned on in his bedroom; partly because of his old timidity, and partly so that, if he should wake in the night, there would be no wretched moment of doubt, no horrible suspicion of yellow wallpaper, or of Washington and Calvin above his bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday morning the city was practically snowbound. Paul breakfasted late, and in the afternoon he fell in with a wild San Francisco boy, a freshman at Yale, who said he had run down for a \"little flyer\" over Sunday. The young man offered to show Paul the night side of the town, and the two boys went out together after dinner, not returning to the hotel until seven o'clock the next morning. They had started out in the confiding warmth of a champagne friendship, but their parting in the elevator was singularly cool. The freshman pulled himself together to make his train, and Paul went to bed. He awoke at two o'clock in the afternoon, very thirsty and dizzy, and rang for icewater, coffee, and the Pittsburgh papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the part of the hotel management, Paul excited no suspicion. There was this to be said for him, that he wore his spoils with dignity and in no way made himself conspicuous. Even under the glow of his wine he was never boisterous, though he found the stuff like a magician's wand for wonder-building. His chief greediness lay in his ears and eyes, and his excesses were not offensive ones. His dearest pleasures were the gray winter twilights in his sitting room; his quiet enjoyment of his flowers, his clothes, his wide divan, his cigarette, and his sense of power. He could not remember a time when he had felt so at peace with himself. The mere release from the necessity of petty lying, lying every day and every day, restored his self-respect. He had never lied for pleasure, even at school; but to be noticed and admired, to assert his difference from other Cordelia Street boys; and he felt a good deal more manly, more honest, even, now that he had no need for boastful pretensions, now that he could, as his actor friends used to say, \"dress the part.\" It was characteristic that remorse did not occur to him. His golden days went by without a shadow, and he made each as perfect as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the eighth day after his arrival in New York he found the whole affair exploited in the Pittsburgh papers, exploited with a wealth of detail which indicated that local news of a sensational nature was at a low ebb. The firm of Denny & Carson announced that the boy's father had refunded the full amount of the theft and that they had no intention of prosecuting. The Cumberland minister had been interviewed, and expressed his hope of yet reclaiming the motherless lad, and his Sabbath-school teacher declared that she would spare no effort to that end. The rumor had reached Pittsburgh that the boy had been seen in a New York hotel, and his father had gone East to find him and bring him home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul had just come in to dress for dinner; he sank into a chair, weak to the knees, and clasped his head in his hands. It was to be worse than jail, even; the tepid waters of Cordelia Street were to close over him finally and forever. The gray monotony stretched before him in hopeless, unrelieved years; Sabbath school, Young People's Meeting, the yellow-papered room, the damp dishtowels; it all rushed back upon him with a sickening vividness. He had the old feeling that the orchestra had suddenly stopped, the sinking sensation that the play was over. The sweat broke out on his face, and he sprang to his feet, looked about him with his white, conscious smile, and winked at himself in the mirror, With something of the old childish belief in miracles with which he had so often gone to class, all his lessons unlearned, Paul dressed and dashed whistling down the corridor to the elevator.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had no sooner entered the dining room and caught the measure of the music than his remembrance was lightened by his old elastic power of claiming the moment, mounting with it, and finding it all-sufficient. The glare and glitter about him, the mere scenic accessories had again, and for the last time, their old potency. He would show himself that he was game, he would finish the thing splendidly. He doubted, more than ever, the existence of Cordelia Street, and for the first time he drank his wine recklessly. Was he not, after all, one of those fortunate beings born to the purple, was he not still himself and in his own place? He drummed a nervous accompaniment to the Pagliacci music and looked about him, telling himself over and over that it had paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "He reflected drowsily, to the swell of the music and the chill sweetness of his wine, that he might have done it more wisely. He might have caught an outbound steamer and been well out of their clutches before now. But the other side of the world had seemed too far away and too uncertain then; he could not have waited for it; his need had been too sharp. If he had to choose over again, he would do the same thing tomorrow. He looked affectionately about the dining room, now gilded with a soft mist. Ah, it had paid indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul was awakened next morning by a painful throbbing in his head and feet. He had thrown himself across the bed without undressing, and had slept with his shoes on. His limbs and hands were lead heavy, and his tongue and throat were parched and burnt. There came upon him one of those fateful attacks of clearheadedness that never occurred except when he was physically exhausted and his nerves hung loose. He lay still, closed his eyes, and let the tide of things wash over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father was in New York; \"stopping at some joint or other,\" he told himself. The memory of successive summers on the front stoop fell upon him like a weight of black water. He had not a hundred dollars left; and he knew now, more than ever, that money was everything, the wall that stood between all he loathed and all he wanted. The thing was winding itself up; he had thought of that on his first glorious day in New York, and had even provided a way to snap the thread. It lay on his dressing table now; he had got it out last night when he came blindly up from dinner, but the shiny metal hurt his eyes, and he disliked the looks of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose and moved about with a painful effort, succumbing now and again to attacks of nausea. It was the old depression exaggerated; all the world had become Cordelia Street. Yet somehow he was not afraid of anything, was absolutely calm; perhaps because he had looked into the dark corner at last and knew. It was bad enough, what he saw there, but somehow not so bad as his long fear of it had been. He saw everything clearly now. He had a feeling that he had made the best of it, that he had lived the sort of life he was meant to live, and for half an hour he sat staring at the revolver. But he told himself that was not the way, so he went downstairs and took a cab to the ferry.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Paul arrived in Newark he got off the train and took another cab, directing the driver to follow the Pennsylvania tracks out of the town. The snow lay heavy on the roadways and had drifted deep in the open fields. Only here and there the dead grass or dried weed stalks projected, singularly black, above it. Once well into the country, Paul dismissed the carriage and walked, floundering along the tracks, his mind a medley of irrelevant things. He seemed to hold in his brain an actual picture of everything he had seen that morning. He remembered every feature of both his drivers, of the toothless old woman from whom he had bought the red flowers in his coat, the agent from whom he had got his ticket, and all of his fellow passengers on the ferry. His mind, unable to cope with vital matters near at hand, worked feverishly and deftly at sorting and grouping these images. They made for him a part of the ugliness of the world, of the ache in his head, and the bitter burning on his tongue. He stooped and put a handful of snow into his mouth as he walked, but that, too, seemed hot. When he reached a little hillside, where the tracks ran through a cut some twenty feet below him, he stopped and sat down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carnations in his coat were drooping with the cold, he noticed, their red glory all over. It occurred to him that all the flowers he had seen in the glass cases that first night must have gone the same way, long before this. It was only one splendid breath they had, in spite of their brave mockery at the winter outside the glass; and it was a losing game in the end, it seemed, this revolt against the homilies by which the world is run. Paul took one of the blossoms carefully from his coat and scooped a little hole in the snow, where he covered it up. Then he dozed awhile, from his weak condition, seemingly insensible to the cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of an approaching train awoke him, and he started to his feet, remembering only his resolution, and afraid lest he should be too late. He stood watching the approaching locomotive, his teeth chattering, his lips drawn away from them in a frightened smile; once or twice he glanced nervously sidewise, as though he were being watched. When the right moment came, he jumped. As he fell, the folly of his haste occurred to him with merciless clearness, the vastness of what he had left undone. There flashed through his brain, clearer than ever before, the blue of Adriatic water, the yellow of Algerian sands.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt something strike his chest, and that his body was being thrown swiftly through the air, on and on, immeasurably far and fast, while his limbs were gently relaxed. Then, because the picture-making mechanism was crushed, the disturbing visions flashed into black, and Paul dropped back into the immense design of things.\n",

      "It was a dark autumn night. The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party one autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had been interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of capital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many journalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They considered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable for Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty ought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\"I don't agree with you,\" said their host the banker. \"I have not tried either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may judge _a priori_, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than imprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more humane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out of you in the course of many years?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both are equally immoral,\" observed one of the guests, \"for they both have the same object -- to take away life. The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.\"\n",
      "Among the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty. When he was asked his opinion, he said:\n",
      "\"The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at all.\"\n",
      "A lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous in those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he struck the table with his fist and shouted at the young man:\n",
      "\"It's not true! I'll bet you two millions you wouldn't stay in solitary confinement for five years.\"\n",
      "\"If you mean that in earnest,\" said the young man, \"I'll take the bet, but I would stay not five but fifteen years.\"\n",
      "\"Fifteen? Done!\" cried the banker. \"Gentlemen, I stake two millions!\"\n",
      "\"Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!\" said the young man.\n",
      "And this wild, senseless bet was carried out! The banker, spoilt and frivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet. At supper he made fun of the young man, and said:\n",
      "\"Think better of it, young man, while there is still time. To me two millions are a trifle, but you are losing three or four of the best years of your life. I say three or four, because you won't stay longer. Don't forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary confinement is a great deal harder to bear than compulsory. The thought that you have the right to step out in liberty at any moment will poison your whole existence in prison. I am sorry for you.\"\n",
      "And now the banker, walking to and fro, remembered all this, and asked himself: \"What was the object of that bet? What is the good of that man's losing fifteen years of his life and my throwing away two millions? Can it prove that the death penalty is better or worse than imprisonment for life? No, no. It was all nonsensical and meaningless. On my part it was the caprice of a pampered man, and on his part simple greed for money. . . .\"\n",
      "Then he remembered what followed that evening. It was decided that the young man should spend the years of his captivity under the strictest supervision in one of the lodges in the banker's garden. It was agreed that for fifteen years he should not be free to cross the threshold of the lodge, to see human beings, to hear the human voice, or to receive letters and newspapers. He was allowed to have a musical instrument and books, and was allowed to write letters, to drink wine, and to smoke. By the terms of the agreement, the only relations he could have with the outer world were by a little window made purposely for that object. He might have anything he wanted -- books, music, wine, and so on -- in any quantity he desired by writing an order, but could only receive them through the window. The agreement provided for every detail and every trifle that would make his imprisonment strictly solitary, and bound the young man to stay there _exactly_ fifteen years, beginning from twelve o'clock of November 14, 1870, and ending at twelve o'clock of November 14, 1885. The slightest attempt on his part to break the conditions, if only two minutes before the end, released the banker from the obligation to pay him two millions.\n",
      "For the first year of his confinement, as far as one could judge from his brief notes, the prisoner suffered severely from loneliness and depression. The sounds of the piano could be heard continually day and night from his lodge. He refused wine and tobacco. Wine, he wrote, excites the desires, and desires are the worst foes of the prisoner; and besides, nothing could be more dreary than drinking good wine and seeing no one. And tobacco spoilt the air of his room. In the first year the books he sent for were principally of a light character; novels with a complicated love plot, sensational and fantastic stories, and so on.\n",
      "In the second year the piano was silent in the lodge, and the prisoner asked only for the classics. In the fifth year music was audible again, and the prisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him through the window said that all that year he spent doing nothing but eating and drinking and lying on his bed, frequently yawning and angrily talking to himself. He did not read books. Sometimes at night he would sit down to write; he would spend hours writing, and in the morning tear up all that he had written. More than once he could be heard crying.\n",
      "In the second half of the sixth year the prisoner began zealously studying languages, philosophy, and history. He threw himself eagerly into these studies -- so much so that the banker had enough to do to get him the books he ordered. In the course of four years some six hundred volumes were procured at his request. It was during this period that the banker received the following letter from his prisoner:\n",
      "\"My dear Jailer, I write you these lines in six languages. Show them to people who know the languages. Let them read them. If they find not one mistake I implore you to fire a shot in the garden. That shot will show me that my efforts have not been thrown away. The geniuses of all ages and of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in them all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels now from being able to understand them!\" The prisoner's desire was fulfilled. The banker ordered two shots to be fired in the garden.\n",
      "Then after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and read nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man who in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste nearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension. Theology and histories of religion followed the Gospels.\n",
      "In the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an immense quantity of books quite indiscriminately. At one time he was busy with the natural sciences, then he would ask for Byron or Shakespeare. There were notes in which he demanded at the same time books on chemistry, and a manual of medicine, and a novel, and some treatise on philosophy or theology. His reading suggested a man swimming in the sea among the wreckage of his ship, and trying to save his life by greedily clutching first at one spar and then at another.\n",
      "II\n",
      "The old banker remembered all this, and thought:\n",
      "\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock he will regain his freedom. By our agreement I ought to pay him two millions. If I do pay him, it is all over with me: I shall be utterly ruined.\"\n",
      "Fifteen years before, his millions had been beyond his reckoning; now he was afraid to ask himself which were greater, his debts or his assets. Desperate gambling on the Stock Exchange, wild speculation and the excitability which he could not get over even in advancing years, had by degrees led to the decline of his fortune and the proud, fearless, self-confident millionaire had become a banker of middling rank, trembling at every rise and fall in his investments. \"Cursed bet!\" muttered the old man, clutching his head in despair \"Why didn't the man die? He is only forty now. He will take my last penny from me, he will marry, will enjoy life, will gamble on the Exchange; while I shall look at him with envy like a beggar, and hear from him every day the same sentence: 'I am indebted to you for the happiness of my life, let me help you!' No, it is too much! The one means of being saved from bankruptcy and disgrace is the death of that man!\"\n",
      "It struck three o'clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the house and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled trees. Trying to make no noise, he took from a fireproof safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house.\n",
      "It was dark and cold in the garden. Rain was falling. A damp cutting wind was racing about the garden, howling and giving the trees no rest. The banker strained his eyes, but could see neither the earth nor the white statues, nor the lodge, nor the trees. Going to the spot where the lodge stood, he twice called the watchman. No answer followed. Evidently the watchman had sought shelter from the weather, and was now asleep somewhere either in the kitchen or in the greenhouse.\n",
      "\"If I had the pluck to carry out my intention,\" thought the old man, \"Suspicion would fall first upon the watchman.\"\n",
      "He felt in the darkness for the steps and the door, and went into the entry of the lodge. Then he groped his way into a little passage and lighted a match. There was not a soul there. There was a bedstead with no bedding on it, and in the corner there was a dark cast-iron stove. The seals on the door leading to the prisoner's rooms were intact.\n",
      "When the match went out the old man, trembling with emotion, peeped through the little window. A candle was burning dimly in the prisoner's room. He was sitting at the table. Nothing could be seen but his back, the hair on his head, and his hands. Open books were lying on the table, on the two easy-chairs, and on the carpet near the table.\n",
      "Five minutes passed and the prisoner did not once stir. Fifteen years' imprisonment had taught him to sit still. The banker tapped at the window with his finger, and the prisoner made no movement whatever in response. Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and put the key in the keyhole. The rusty lock gave a grating sound and the door creaked. The banker expected to hear at once footsteps and a cry of astonishment, but three minutes passed and it was as quiet as ever in the room. He made up his mind to go in.\n",
      "At the table a man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless. He was a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls like a woman's and a shaggy beard. His face was yellow with an earthy tint in it, his cheeks were hollow, his back long and narrow, and the hand on which his shaggy head was propped was so thin and delicate that it was dreadful to look at it. His hair was already streaked with silver, and seeing his emaciated, aged-looking face, no one would have believed that he was only forty. He was asleep. . . . In front of his bowed head there lay on the table a sheet of paper on which there was something written in fine handwriting.\n",
      "\"Poor creature!\" thought the banker, \"he is asleep and most likely dreaming of the millions. And I have only to take this half-dead man, throw him on the bed, stifle him a little with the pillow, and the most conscientious expert would find no sign of a violent death. But let us first read what he has written here. . . .\"\n",
      "The banker took the page from the table and read as follows:\n",
      "\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock I regain my freedom and the right to associate with other men, but before I leave this room and see the sunshine, I think it necessary to say a few words to you. With a clear conscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise freedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the good things of the world.\n",
      "\"For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is true I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk fragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars in the forests, have loved women. . . . Beauties as ethereal as clouds, created by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at night, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my brain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz and Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched it at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold and crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my head and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the strains of the shepherds' pipes; I have touched the wings of comely devils who flew down to converse with me of God. . . . In your books I have flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain, burned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms. . . .\n",
      "\"Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man has created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain. I know that I am wiser than all of you.\n",
      "\"And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.\n",
      "\"You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don't want to understand you.\n",
      "\"To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I renounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and which now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall go out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the compact. . . .\"\n",
      "When the banker had read this he laid the page on the table, kissed the strange man on the head, and went out of the lodge, weeping. At no other time, even when he had lost heavily on the Stock Exchange, had he felt so great a contempt for himself. When he got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.\n",
      "Next morning the watchmen ran in with pale faces, and told him they had seen the man who lived in the lodge climb out of the window into the garden, go to the gate, and disappear. The banker went at once with the servants to the lodge and made sure of the flight of his prisoner. To avoid arousing unnecessary talk, he took from the table the writing in which the millions were renounced, and when he got home locked it up in the fireproof safe.\n",

      "Olenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov, was sitting in her back porch, lost in thought. It was hot, the flies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect that it would soon be evening. Dark rainclouds were gathering from the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in the air.\n",
      "Kukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli, and who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden looking at the sky.\n",
      "\"Again!\" he observed despairingly. \"It's going to rain again! Rain every day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It's ruin! Fearful losses every day.\"\n",
      "He flung up his hands, and went on, addressing Olenka:\n",
      "\"There! that's the life we lead, Olga Semyonovna. It's enough to make one cry. One works and does one's utmost, one wears oneself out, getting no sleep at night, and racks one's brain what to do for the best. And then what happens? To begin with, one's public is ignorant, boorish. I give them the very best operetta, a dainty masque, first rate music-hall artists. But do you suppose that's what they want! They don't understand anything of that sort. They want a clown; what they ask for is vulgarity. And then look at the weather! Almost every evening it rains. It started on the tenth of May, and it's kept it up all May and June. It's simply awful! The public doesn't come, but I've to pay the rent just the same, and pay the artists.\"\n",
      "The next evening the clouds would gather again, and Kukin would say with an hysterical laugh:\n",
      "\"Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck in this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! Send me to prison! -- to Siberia! -- the scaffold! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "And next day the same thing.\n",
      "Olenka listened to Kukin with silent gravity, and sometimes tears came into her eyes. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she grew to love him. He was a small thin man, with a yellow face, and curls combed forward on his forehead. He spoke in a thin tenor; as he talked his mouth worked on one side, and there was always an expression of despair on his face; yet he aroused a deep and genuine affection in her. She was always fond of some one, and could not exist without loving. In earlier days she had loved her papa, who now sat in a darkened room, breathing with difficulty; she had loved her aunt who used to come every other year from Bryansk; and before that, when she was at school, she had loved her French master. She was a gentle, soft-hearted, compassionate girl, with mild, tender eyes and very good health. At the sight of her full rosy cheeks, her soft white neck with a little dark mole on it, and the kind, naÃ¯ve smile, which came into her face when she listened to anything pleasant, men thought, \"Yes, not half bad,\" and smiled too, while lady visitors could not refrain from seizing her hand in the middle of a conversation, exclaiming in a gush of delight, \"You darling!\"\n",
      "The house in which she had lived from her birth upwards, and which was left her in her father's will, was at the extreme end of the town, not far from the Tivoli. In the evenings and at night she could hear the band playing, and the crackling and banging of fireworks, and it seemed to her that it was Kukin struggling with his destiny, storming the entrenchments of his chief foe, the indifferent public; there was a sweet thrill at her heart, she had no desire to sleep, and when he returned home at day-break, she tapped softly at her bedroom window, and showing him only her face and one shoulder through the curtain, she gave him a friendly smileÂ",
      "\n",
      "He proposed to her, and they were married. And when he had a closer view of her neck and her plump, fine shoulders, he threw up his hands, and said:\n",
      "\"You darling!\"\n",
      "He was happy, but as it rained on the day and night of his wedding, his face still retained an expression of despair.\n",
      "They got on very well together. She used to sit in his office, to look after things in the Tivoli, to put down the accounts and pay the wages. And her rosy cheeks, her sweet, naÃ¯ve, radiant smile, were to be seen now at the office window, now in the refreshment bar or behind the scenes of the theatre. And already she used to say to her acquaintances that the theatre was the chief and most important thing in life and that it was only through the drama that one could derive true enjoyment and become cultivated and humane.\n",
      "\"But do you suppose the public understands that?\" she used to say. \"What they want is a clown. Yesterday we gave 'Faust Inside Out,' and almost all the boxes were empty; but if Vanitchka and I had been producing some vulgar thing, I assure you the theatre would have been packed. Tomorrow Vanitchka and I are doing 'Orpheus in Hell.' Do come.\"\n",
      "And what Kukin said about the theatre and the actors she repeated. Like him she despised the public for their ignorance and their indifference to art; she took part in the rehearsals, she corrected the actors, she kept an eye on the behaviour of the musicians, and when there was an unfavourable notice in the local paper, she shed tears, and then went to the editor's office to set things right.\n",
      "The actors were fond of her and used to call her \"Vanitchka and I,\" and \"the darling\"; she was sorry for them and used to lend them small sums of money, and if they deceived her, she used to shed a few tears in private, but did not complain to her husband.\n",
      "They got on well in the winter too. They took the theatre in the town for the whole winter, and let it for short terms to a Little Russian company, or to a conjurer, or to a local dramatic society. Olenka grew stouter, and was always beaming with satisfaction, while Kukin grew thinner and yellower, and continually complained of their terrible losses, although he had not done badly all the winter. He used to cough at night, and she used to give him hot raspberry tea or lime-flower water, to rub him with eau-de-Cologne and to wrap him in her warm shawls.\n",
      "\"You're such a sweet pet!\" she used to say with perfect sincerity, stroking his hair. \"You're such a pretty dear!\"\n",
      "Towards Lent he went to Moscow to collect a new troupe, and without him she could not sleep, but sat all night at her window, looking at the stars, and she compared herself with the hens, who are awake all night and uneasy when the cock is not in the hen-house. Kukin was detained in Moscow, and wrote that he would be back at Easter, adding some instructions about the Tivoli. But on the Sunday before Easter, late in the evening, came a sudden ominous knock at the gate; some one was hammering on the gate as though on a barrel -- boom, boom, boom! The drowsy cook went flopping with her bare feet through the puddles, as she ran to open the gate.\n",
      "\"Please open,\" said some one outside in a thick bass. \"There is a telegram for you.\"\n",
      "Olenka had received telegrams from her husband before, but this time for some reason she felt numb with terror. With shaking hands she opened the telegram and read as follows:\n",
      "\"IVAN PETROVITCH DIED SUDDENLY TO-DAY. AWAITING IMMATE INSTRUCTIONS FUFUNERAL TUESDAY.\"\n",
      "That was how it was written in the telegram -- \"fufuneral,\" and the utterly incomprehensible word \"immate.\" It was signed by the stage manager of the operatic company.\n",
      "\"My darling!\" sobbed Olenka. \"Vanka, my precious, my darling! Why did I ever meet you! Why did I know you and love you! Your poor heart-broken Olenka is alone without you!\"\n",
      "Kukin's funeral took place on Tuesday in Moscow, Olenka returned home on Wednesday, and as soon as she got indoors, she threw herself on her bed and sobbed so loudly that it could be heard next door, and in the street.\n",
      "\"Poor darling!\" the neighbours said, as they crossed themselves. \"Olga Semyonovna, poor darling! How she does take on!\"\n",
      "Three months later Olenka was coming home from mass, melancholy and in deep mourning. It happened that one of her neighbours, Vassily Andreitch Pustovalov, returning home from church, walked back beside her. He was the manager at Babakayev's, the timber merchant's. He wore a straw hat, a white waistcoat, and a gold watch-chain, and looked more a country gentleman than a man in trade.\n",
      "\"Everything happens as it is ordained, Olga Semyonovna,\" he said gravely, with a sympathetic note in his voice; \"and if any of our dear ones die, it must be because it is the will of God, so we ought have fortitude and bear it submissively.\"\n",
      "After seeing Olenka to her gate, he said good-bye and went on. All day afterwards she heard his sedately dignified voice, and whenever she shut her eyes she saw his dark beard. She liked him very much. And apparently she had made an impression on him too, for not long afterwards an elderly lady, with whom she was only slightly acquainted, came to drink coffee with her, and as soon as she was seated at table began to talk about Pustovalov, saying that he was an excellent man whom one could thoroughly depend upon, and that any girl would be glad to marry him. Three days later Pustovalov came himself. He did not stay long, only about ten minutes, and he did not say much, but when he left, Olenka loved him -- loved him so much that she lay awake all night in a perfect fever, and in the morning she sent for the elderly lady. The match was quickly arranged, and then came the wedding.\n",
      "Pustovalov and Olenka got on very well together when they were married.\n",
      "Usually he sat in the office till dinner-time, then he went out on business, while Olenka took his place, and sat in the office till evening, making up accounts and booking orders.\n",
      "\"Timber gets dearer every year; the price rises twenty per cent,\" she would say to her customers and friends. \"Only fancy we used to sell local timber, and now Vassitchka always has to go for wood to the Mogilev district. And the freight!\" she would add, covering her cheeks with her hands in horror. \"The freight!\"\n",
      "It seemed to her that she had been in the timber trade for ages and ages, and that the most important and necessary thing in life was timber; and there was something intimate and touching to her in the very sound of words such as \"baulk,\" \"post,\" \"beam,\" \"pole,\" \"scantling,\" \"batten,\" \"lath,\" \"plank,\" etc.\n",
      "At night when she was asleep she dreamed of perfect mountains of planks and boards, and long strings of wagons, carting timber somewhere far away. She dreamed that a whole regiment of six-inch beams forty feet high, standing on end, was marching upon the timber-yard; that logs, beams, and boards knocked together with the resounding crash of dry wood, kept falling and getting up again, piling themselves on each other. Olenka cried out in her sleep, and Pustovalov said to her tenderly: \"Olenka, what's the matter, darling? Cross yourself!\"\n",
      "Her husband's ideas were hers. If he thought the room was too hot, or that business was slack, she thought the same. Her husband did not care for entertainments, and on holidays he stayed at home. She did likewise.\n",
      "\"You are always at home or in the office,\" her friends said to her. \"You should go to the theatre, darling, or to the circus.\"\n",
      "\"Vassitchka and I have no time to go to theatres,\" she would answer sedately. \"We have no time for nonsense. What's the use of these theatres?\"\n",
      "On Saturdays Pustovalov and she used to go to the evening service; on holidays to early mass, and they walked side by side with softened faces as they came home from church. There was a pleasant fragrance about them both, and her silk dress rustled agreeably. At home they drank tea, with fancy bread and jams of various kinds, and afterwards they ate pie. Every day at twelve o'clock there was a savoury smell of beet-root soup and of mutton or duck in their yard, and on fast-days of fish, and no one could pass the gate without feeling hungry. In the office the samovar was always boiling, and customers were regaled with tea and cracknels. Once a week the couple went to the baths and returned side by side, both red in the face.\n",
      "\"Yes, we have nothing to complain of, thank God,\" Olenka used to say to her acquaintances. \"I wish every one were as well off as Vassitchka and I.\"\n",
      "When Pustovalov went away to buy wood in the Mogilev district, she missed him dreadfully, lay awake and cried. A young veterinary surgeon in the army, called Smirnin, to whom they had let their lodge, used sometimes to come in in the evening. He used to talk to her and play cards with her, and this entertained her in her husband's absence. She was particularly interested in what he told her of his home life. He was married and had a little boy, but was separated from his wife because she had been unfaithful to him, and now he hated her and used to send her forty roubles a month for the maintenance of their son. And hearing of all this, Olenka sighed and shook her head. She was sorry for him.\n",
      "\"Well, God keep you,\" she used to say to him at parting, as she lighted him down the stairs with a candle. \"Thank you for coming to cheer me up, and may the Mother of God give you health.\"\n",
      "And she always expressed herself with the same sedateness and dignity, the same reasonableness, in imitation of her husband. As the veterinary surgeon was disappearing behind the door below, she would say:\n",
      "\"You know, Vladimir Platonitch, you'd better make it up with your wife. You should forgive her for the sake of your son. You may be sure the little fellow understands.\"\n",
      "And when Pustovalov came back, she told him in a low voice about the veterinary surgeon and his unhappy home life, and both sighed and shook their heads and talked about the boy, who, no doubt, missed his father, and by some strange connection of ideas, they went up to the holy ikons, bowed to the ground before them and prayed that God would give them children.\n",
      "And so the Pustovalovs lived for six years quietly and peaceably in love and complete harmony.\n",
      "But behold! one winter day after drinking hot tea in the office, Vassily Andreitch went out into the yard without his cap on to see about sending off some timber, caught cold and was taken ill. He had the best doctors, but he grew worse and died after four months' illness. And Olenka was a widow once more.\n",
      "\"I've nobody, now you've left me, my darling,\" she sobbed, after her husband's funeral. \"How can I live without you, in wretchedness and misery! Pity me, good people, all alone in the world!\"\n",
      "She went about dressed in black with long \"weepers,\" and gave up wearing hat and gloves for good. She hardly ever went out, except to church, or to her husband's grave, and led the life of a nun. It was not till six months later that she took off the weepers and opened the shutters of the windows. She was sometimes seen in the mornings, going with her cook to market for provisions, but what went on in her house and how she lived now could only be surmised. People guessed, from seeing her drinking tea in her garden with the veterinary surgeon, who read the newspaper aloud to her, and from the fact that, meeting a lady she knew at the post-office, she said to her:\n",
      "\"There is no proper veterinary inspection in our town, and that's the cause of all sorts of epidemics. One is always hearing of people's getting infection from the milk supply, or catching diseases from horses and cows. The health of domestic animals ought to be as well cared for as the health of human beings.\"\n",
      "She repeated the veterinary surgeon's words, and was of the same opinion as he about everything. It was evident that she could not live a year without some attachment, and had found new happiness in the lodge. In any one else this would have been censured, but no one could think ill of Olenka; everything she did was so natural. Neither she nor the veterinary surgeon said anything to other people of the change in their relations, and tried, indeed, to conceal it, but without success, for Olenka could not keep a secret. When he had visitors, men serving in his regiment, and she poured out tea or served the supper, she would begin talking of the cattle plague, of the foot and mouth disease, and of the municipal slaughterhouses. He was dreadfully embarrassed, and when the guests had gone, he would seize her by the hand and hiss angrily:\n",
      "\"I've asked you before not to talk about what you don't understand. When we veterinary surgeons are talking among ourselves, please don't put your word in. It's really annoying.\"\n",
      "And she would look at him with astonishment and dismay, and ask him in alarm: \"But, Voloditchka, what am I to talk about?\"\n",
      "And with tears in her eyes she would embrace him, begging him not to be angry, and they were both happy.\n",
      "But this happiness did not last long. The veterinary surgeon departed, departed for ever with his regiment, when it was transferred to a distant place -- to Siberia, it may be. And Olenka was left alone.\n",
      "Now she was absolutely alone. Her father had long been dead, and his armchair lay in the attic, covered with dust and lame of one leg. She got thinner and plainer, and when people met her in the street they did not look at her as they used to, and did not smile to her; evidently her best years were over and left behind, and now a new sort of life had begun for her, which did not bear thinking about. In the evening Olenka sat in the porch, and heard the band playing and the fireworks popping in the Tivoli, but now the sound stirred no response. She looked into her yard without interest, thought of nothing, wished for nothing, and afterwards, when night came on she went to bed and dreamed of her empty yard. She ate and drank as it were unwillingly.\n",
      "And what was worst of all, she had no opinions of any sort. She saw the objects about her and understood what she saw, but could not form any opinion about them, and did not know what to talk about. And how awful it is not to have any opinions! One sees a bottle, for instance, or the rain, or a peasant driving in his cart, but what the bottle is for, or the rain, or the peasant, and what is the meaning of it, one can't say, and could not even for a thousand roubles. When she had Kukin, or Pustovalov, or the veterinary surgeon, Olenka could explain everything, and give her opinion about anything you like, but now there was the same emptiness in her brain and in her heart as there was in her yard outside. And it was as harsh and as bitter as wormwood in the mouth.\n",
      "Little by little the town grew in all directions. The road became a street, and where the Tivoli and the timber-yard had been, there were new turnings and houses. How rapidly time passes! Olenka's house grew dingy, the roof got rusty, the shed sank on one side, and the whole yard was overgrown with docks and stinging-nettles. Olenka herself had grown plain and elderly; in summer she sat in the porch, and her soul, as before, was empty and dreary and full of bitterness. In winter she sat at her window and looked at the snow. When she caught the scent of spring, or heard the chime of the church bells, a sudden rush of memories from the past came over her, there was a tender ache in her heart, and her eyes brimmed over with tears; but this was only for a minute, and then came emptiness again and the sense of the futility of life. The black kitten, Briska, rubbed against her and purred softly, but Olenka was not touched by these feline caresses. That was not what she needed. She wanted a love that would absorb her whole being, her whole soul and reason -- that would give her ideas and an object in life, and would warm her old blood. And she would shake the kitten off her skirt and say with vexation:\n",
      "\"Get along; I don't want you!\"\n",
      "And so it was, day after day and year after year, and no joy, and no opinions. Whatever Mavra, the cook, said she accepted.\n",
      "One hot July day, towards evening, just as the cattle were being driven away, and the whole yard was full of dust, some one suddenly knocked at the gate. Olenka went to open it herself and was dumbfounded when she looked out: she saw Smirnin, the veterinary surgeon, grey-headed, and dressed as a civilian. She suddenly remembered everything. She could not help crying and letting her head fall on his breast without uttering a word, and in the violence of her feeling she did not notice how they both walked into the house and sat down to tea.\n",
      "\"My dear Vladimir Platonitch! What fate has brought you?\" she muttered, trembling with joy.\n",
      "\"I want to settle here for good, Olga Semyonovna,\" he told her. \"I have resigned my post, and have come to settle down and try my luck on my own account. Besides, it's time for my boy to go to school. He's a big boy. I am reconciled with my wife, you know.\"\n",
      "\"Where is she?' asked Olenka.\n",
      "\"She's at the hotel with the boy, and I'm looking for lodgings.\"\n",
      "\"Good gracious, my dear soul! Lodgings? Why not have my house? Why shouldn't that suit you? Why, my goodness, I wouldn't take any rent!\" cried Olenka in a flutter, beginning to cry again. \"You live here, and the lodge will do nicely for me. Oh dear! how glad I am!\"\n",
      "Next day the roof was painted and the walls were whitewashed, and Olenka, with her arms akimbo walked about the yard giving directions. Her face was beaming with her old smile, and she was brisk and alert as though she had waked from a long sleep. The veterinary's wife arrived -- a thin, plain lady, with short hair and a peevish expression. With her was her little Sasha, a boy of ten, small for his age, blue-eyed, chubby, with dimples in his cheeks. And scarcely had the boy walked into the yard when he ran after the cat, and at once there was the sound of his gay, joyous laugh.\n",
      "\"Is that your puss, auntie?\" he asked Olenka. \"When she has little ones, do give us a kitten. Mamma is awfully afraid of mice.\"\n",
      "Olenka talked to him, and gave him tea. Her heart warmed and there was a sweet ache in her bosom, as though the boy had been her own child. And when he sat at the table in the evening, going over his lessons, she looked at him with deep tenderness and pity as she murmured to herself:\n",
      "\"You pretty pet! Â",
      " my precious! Â",
      " Such a fair little thing, and so clever.\"\n",
      "\" 'An island is a piece of land which is entirely surrounded by water,' \" he read aloud.\n",
      "\"An island is a piece of land,\" she repeated, and this was the first opinion to which she gave utterance with positive conviction after so many years of silence and dearth of ideas.\n",
      "Now she had opinions of her own, and at supper she talked to Sasha's parents, saying how difficult the lessons were at the high schools, but that yet the high school was better than a commercial one, since with a high-school education all careers were open to one, such as being a doctor or an engineer.\n",
      "Sasha began going to the high school. His mother departed to Harkov to her sister's and did not return; his father used to go off every day to inspect cattle, and would often be away from home for three days together, and it seemed to Olenka as though Sasha was entirely abandoned, that he was not wanted at home, that he was being starved, and she carried him off to her lodge and gave him a little room there.\n",
      "And for six months Sasha had lived in the lodge with her. Every morning Olenka came into his bedroom and found him fast asleep, sleeping noiselessly with his hand under his cheek. She was sorry to wake him.\n",
      "\"Sashenka,\" she would say mournfully, \"get up, darling. It's time for school.\"\n",
      "He would get up, dress and say his prayers, and then sit down to breakfast, drink three glasses of tea, and eat two large cracknels and a half a buttered roll. All this time he was hardly awake and a little ill-humoured in consequence.\n",
      "\"You don't quite know your fable, Sashenka,\" Olenka would say, looking at him as though he were about to set off on a long journey. \"What a lot of trouble I have with you! You must work and do your best, darling, and obey your teachers.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, do leave me alone!\" Sasha would say.\n",
      "Then he would go down the street to school, a little figure, wearing a big cap and carrying a satchel on his shoulder. Olenka would follow him noiselessly.\n",
      "\"Sashenka!\" she would call after him, and she would pop into his hand a date or a caramel. When he reached the street where the school was, he would feel ashamed of being followed by a tall, stout woman, he would turn round and say:\n",
      "\"You'd better go home, auntie. I can go the rest of the way alone.\"\n",
      "She would stand still and look after him fixedly till he had disappeared at the school-gate.\n",
      "Ah, how she loved him! Of her former attachments not one had been so deep; never had her soul surrendered to any feeling so spontaneously, so disinterestedly, and so joyously as now that her maternal instincts were aroused. For this little boy with the dimple in his cheek and the big school cap, she would have given her whole life, she would have given it with joy and tears of tenderness. Why? Who can tell why?\n",
      "When she had seen the last of Sasha, she returned home, contented and serene, brimming over with love; her face, which had grown younger during the last six months, smiled and beamed; people meeting her looked at her with pleasure.\n",
      "\"Good-morning, Olga Semyonovna, darling. How are you, darling?\"\n",
      "\"The lessons at the high school are very difficult now,\" she would relate at the market. \"It's too much; in the first class yesterday they gave him a fable to learn by heart, and a Latin translation and a problem. You know it's too much for a little chap.\"\n",
      "And she would begin talking about the teachers, the lessons, and the school books, saying just what Sasha said.\n",
      "At three o'clock they had dinner together: in the evening they learned their lessons together and cried. When she put him to bed, she would stay a long time making the Cross over him and murmuring a prayer; then she would go to bed and dream of that far-away misty future when Sasha would finish his studies and become a doctor or an engineer, would have a big house of his own with horses and a carriage, would get married and have children Â",
      " She would fall asleep still thinking of the same thing, and tears would run down her cheeks from her closed eyes, while the black cat lay purring beside her: \"Mrr, mrr, mrr.\"\n",
      "Suddenly there would come a loud knock at the gate.\n",
      "Olenka would wake up breathless with alarm, her heart throbbing. Half a minute later would come another knock.\n",
      "\"It must be a telegram from Harkov,\" she would think, beginning to tremble from head to foot. \"Sasha's mother is sending for him from Harkov.  Oh, mercy on us!\"\n",
      "She was in despair. Her head, her hands, and her feet would turn chill, and she would feel that she was the most unhappy woman in the world. But another minute would pass, voices would be heard: it would turn out to be the veterinary surgeon coming home from the club.\n",
      "\"Well, thank God!\" she would think.\n",
      "And gradually the load in her heart would pass off, and she would feel at ease. She would go back to bed thinking of Sasha, who lay sound asleep in the next room, sometimes crying out in his sleep:\n",
      "\"I'll give it you! Get away! Shut up!\"\n",

      "Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.\n",
      "A dark leaden-coloured mass is creeping over the sky towards the sun. Red zigzags of lightning gleam here and there across it. There is a sound of far-away rumbling. A warm wind frolics over the grass, bends the trees, and stirs up the dust. In a minute there will be a spurt of May rain and a real storm will begin.\n",
      "Fyokla, a little beggar-girl of six, is running through the village, looking for Terenty the cobbler. The white-haired, barefoot child is pale. Her eyes are wide-open, her lips are trembling.\n",
      "\"Uncle, where is Terenty?\" she asks every one she meets. No one answers. They are all preoccupied with the approaching storm and take refuge in their huts. At last she meets Silanty Silitch, the sacristan, Terenty's bosom friend. He is coming along, staggering from the wind.\n",
      "\"Uncle, where is Terenty?\"\n",
      "\"At the kitchen-gardens,\" answers Silanty.\n",
      "The beggar-girl runs behind the huts to the kitchen-gardens and there finds Terenty; the tall old man with a thin, pock-marked face, very long legs, and bare feet, dressed in a woman's tattered jacket, is standing near the vegetable plots, looking with drowsy, drunken eyes at the dark storm-cloud. On his long crane-like legs he sways in the wind like a starling-cote.\n",
      "\"Uncle Terenty!\" the white-headed beggar-girl addresses him. \"Uncle, darling!\"\n",
      "Terenty bends down to Fyokla, and his grim, drunken face is overspread with a smile, such as come into people's faces when they look at something little, foolish, and absurd, but warmly loved.\n",
      "\"Ah! servant of God, Fyokla,\" he says, lisping tenderly, \"where have you come from?\"\n",
      "\"Uncle Terenty,\" says Fyokla, with a sob, tugging at the lapel of the cobbler's coat. \"Brother Danilka has had an accident! Come along!\"\n",
      "\"What sort of accident? Ough, what thunder! Holy, holy, holyÂ",
      ". What sort of accident?\"\n",
      "\"In the count's copse Danilka stuck his hand into a hole in a tree, and he can't get it out. Come along, uncle, do be kind and pull his hand out!\"\n",
      "\"How was it he put his hand in? What for?\"\n",
      "\"He wanted to get a cuckoo's egg out of the hole for me.\"\n",
      "\"The day has hardly begun and already you are in troubleÂ",
      ".\"Terenty shook his head and spat deliberately. \"Well, what am I to do with you now? I must comeÂ",
      " I must, may the wolf gobble you up, you naughty children! Come, little orphan!\"\n",
      "Terenty comes out of the kitchen-garden and, lifting high his long legs, begins striding down the village street. He walks quickly without stopping or looking from side to side, as though he were shoved from behind or afraid of pursuit. Fyokla can hardly keep up with him.\n",
      "They come out of the village and turn along the dusty road towards the count's copse that lies dark blue in the distance. It is about a mile and a half away. The clouds have by now covered the sun, and soon afterwards there is not a speck of blue left in the sky. It grows dark.\n",
      "\"Holy, holy, holyÂ",
      "\" whispers Fyokla, hurrying after Terenty. The first rain-drops, big and heavy, lie, dark dots on the dusty road. A big drop falls on Fyokla's cheek and glides like a tear down her chin.\n",
      "\"The rain has begun,\" mutters the cobbler, kicking up the dust with his bare, bony feet. \"That's fine, Fyokla, old girl. The grass and the trees are fed by the rain, as we are by bread. And as for the thunder, don't you be frightened, little orphan. Why should it kill a little thing like you?\"\n",
      "As soon as the rain begins, the wind drops. The only sound is the patter of rain dropping like fine shot on the young rye and the parched road.\n",
      "\"We shall get soaked, Fyokla,\" mutters Terenty. \"There won't be a dry spot left on usÂ",
      ".Ho-ho, my girl! It's run down my neck! But don't be frightened, sillyÂ",
      ".The grass will be dry again, the earth will be dry again, and we shall be dry again. There is the same sun for us all.\"\n",
      "A flash of lightning, some fourteen feet long, gleams above their head. There is a loud peal of thunder, and it seems to Fyokla that something big, heavy, and round is rolling over the sky and tearing it open, exactly over her head.\n",
      "\"Holy, holy, holyÂ",
      "\" says Terenty, crossing himself. \"Don't be afraid, little orphan! It is not from spite that it thunders.\"\n",
      "Terenty's and Fyokla's feet are covered with lumps of heavy, wet clay. It is slippery and difficult to walk, but Terenty strides on more and more rapidly. The weak little beggar-girl is breathless and ready to drop.\n",
      "But at last they go into the count's copse. The washed trees, stirred by a gust of wind, drop a perfect waterfall upon them. Terenty stumbles over stumps and begins to slacken his pace.\n",
      "\"Whereabouts is Danilka?\" he asks. \"Lead me to him.\"\n",
      "Fyokla leads him into a thicket, and, after going a quarter of a mile, points to Danilka. Her brother, a little fellow of eight, with hair as red as ochre and a pale sickly face, stands leaning against a tree, and, with his head on one side, looking sideways at the sky. In one hand he holds his shabby old cap, the other is hidden in an old lime tree. The boy is gazing at the stormy sky, and apparently not thinking of his trouble. Hearing footsteps and seeing the cobbler he gives sickly smile and says:\n",
      "\"A terrible lot of thunder, TerentyÂ",
      ".I've never heard so much thunder in all my life.\"\n",
      "\"And where is your hand?\"\n",
      "\"In the holeÂ",
      ".Pull it out, please, Terenty!\"\n",
      "The wood had broken at the edge of the hole and jammed Danilka's hand: he could push it farther in, but could not pull it out. Terenty snaps off the broken piece, and the boy's hand, red and crushed, is released.\n",
      "\"It's terrible how it's thundering,\" the boy says again, rubbing his hand. \"What makes it thunder, Terenty?\"\n",
      "\"One cloud runs against the other,\" answers the cobbler. The party come out of the copse, and walk along the edge of it towards the darkened road. The thunder gradually abates, and its rumbling is heard far away beyond the village.\n",
      "\"The ducks flew by here the other day, Terenty,\" says Danilka, still rubbing his hand. \"They must be nesting in the Gniliya Zaimishtcha marshesÂ",
      ".Fyokla, would you like me to show you a nightingale's nest?\"\n",
      "\"Don't touch it, you might disturb them,\" says Terenty, wringing the water out of his cap. \"The nightingale is a singing-bird, without sin. He has had a voice given him in his throat, to praise God and gladden the heart of man. It's a sin to disturb him.\"\n",
      "\"What about the sparrow?\"\n",
      "\"The sparrow doesn't matter, he's a bad, spiteful bird. He is like a pickpocket in his ways. He doesn't like man to be happy. When Christ was crucified it was the sparrow brought nails to the Jews, and called 'alive! alive!' \"\n",
      "A bright patch of blue appears in the sky.\n",
      "\"Look!\" says Terenty. \"An ant-heap burst open by the rain! They've been flooded, the rogues!\"\n",
      "They bend over the ant-heap. The downpour has damaged it; the insects are scurrying to and fro in the mud, agitated, and busily trying to carry away their drowned companions.\n",
      "\"You needn't be in such a taking, you won't die of it!\" says Terenty, grinning. \"As soon as the sun warms you, you'll come to your senses againÂ",
      ".It's a lesson to you, you stupids. You won't settle on low ground another time.\"\n",
      "They go on.\n",
      "\"And here are some bees,\" cries Danilka, pointing to the branch of a young oak tree.\n",
      "The drenched and chilled bees are huddled together on the branch. There are so many of them that neither bark nor leaf can be seen. Many of them are settled on one another.\n",
      "\"That's a swarm of bees,\" Terenty informs them. \"They were flying looking for a home, and when the rain came down upon them they settled. If a swarm is flying, you need only sprinkle water on them to make them settle. Now if, say, you wanted to take the swarm, you would bend the branch with them into a sack and shake it, and they all fall in.\"\n",
      "Little Fyokla suddenly frowns and rubs her neck vigorously. Her brother looks at her neck, and sees a big swelling on it.\n",
      "\"Hey-hey!\" laughs the cobbler. \"Do you know where you got that from, Fyokla, old girl? There are Spanish flies on some tree in the wood. The rain has trickled off them, and a drop has fallen on your neckÂthat's what has made the swelling.\"\n",
      "The sun appears from behind the clouds and floods the wood, the fields, and the three friends with its warm light. The dark menacing cloud has gone far away and taken the storm with it. The air is warm and fragrant. There is a scent of bird-cherry, meadowsweet, and lilies-of-the-valley.\n",
      "\"That herb is given when your nose bleeds,\" says Terenty, pointing to a woolly-looking flower. \"It does good.\"\n",
      "They hear a whistle and a rumble, but not such a rumble as the storm-clouds carried away. A goods train races by before the eyes of Terenty, Danilka, and Fyokla. The engine, panting and puffing out black smoke, drags more than twenty vans after it. Its power is tremendous. The children are interested to know how an engine, not alive and without the help of horses, can move and drag such weights, and Terenty undertakes to explain it to them:\n",
      "\"It's all the steam's doing, childrenÂ",
      ". The steam does the workÂ",
      ". You see, it shoves under that thing near the wheels, and itÂ",
      "you seeÂ",
      "it worksÂ",
      "\"\n",
      "They cross the railway line, and, going down from the embankment, walk towards the river. They walk not with any object, but just at random, and talk all the wayÂ",
      ". Danilka asks questions, Terenty answers themÂ",
      "\n",
      "Terenty answers all his questions, and there is no secret in Nature which baffles him. He knows everything. Thus, for example, he knows the names of all the wild flowers, animals, and stones. He knows what herbs cure diseases, he has no difficulty in telling the age of a horse or a cow. Looking at the sunset, at the moon, or the birds, he can tell what sort of weather it will be next day. And indeed, it is not only Terenty who is so wise. Silanty Silitch, the innkeeper, the market-gardener, the shepherd, and all the villagers, generally speaking, know as much as he does. These people have learned not from books, but in the fields, in the wood, on the river bank. Their teachers have been the birds themselves, when they sang to them, the sun when it left a glow of crimson behind it at setting, the very trees, and wild herbs.\n",
      "Danilka looks at Terenty and greedily drinks in every word. In spring, before one is weary of the warmth and the monotonous green of the fields, when everything is fresh and full of fragrance, who would not want to hear about the golden may-beetles, about the cranes, about the gurgling streams, and the corn mounting into ear?\n",
      "The two of them, the cobbler and the orphan, walk about the fields, talk unceasingly, and are not weary. They could wander about the world endlessly. They walk, and in their talk of the beauty of the earth do not notice the frail little beggar-girl tripping after them. She is breathless and moves with a lagging step. There are tears in her eyes; she would be glad to stop these inexhaustible wanderers, but to whom and where can she go? She has no home or people of her own; whether she likes it or not, she must walk and listen to their talk.\n",
      "Towards midday, all three sit down on the river bank. Danilka takes out of his bag a piece of bread, soaked and reduced to a mash, and they begin to eat. Terenty says a prayer when he has eaten the bread, then stretches himself on the sandy bank and falls asleep. While he is asleep, the boy gazes at the water, pondering. He has many different things to think of. He has just seen the storm, the bees, the ants, the train. Now, before his eyes, fishes are whisking about. Some are two inches long and more, others are no bigger than one's nail. A viper, with its head held high, is swimming from one bank to the other.\n",
      "Only towards the evening our wanderers return to the village. The children go for the night to a deserted barn, where the corn of the commune used to be kept, while Terenty, leaving them, goes to the tavern. The children lie huddled together on the straw, dozing.\n",
      "The boy does not sleep. He gazes into the darkness, and it seems to him that he is seeing all that he has seen in the day: the storm-clouds, the bright sunshine, the birds, the fish, lanky Terenty. The number of his impressions, together with exhaustion and hunger, are too much for him; he is as hot as though he were on fire, and tosses from side to side. He longs to tell someone all that is haunting him now in the darkness and agitating his soul, but there is no one to tell. Fyokla is too little and could not understand.\n",
      "\"I'll tell Terenty to-morrow,\" thinks the boy.\n",
      "The children fall asleep thinking of the homeless cobbler, and, in the night, Terenty comes to them, makes the sign of the cross over them, and puts bread under their heads. And no one sees his love. It is seen only by the moon which floats in the sky and peeps caressingly through the holes in the wall of the deserted barn.\n",

      "now, as he had nothing else to do and as the newspaper was before\n",
      "his eyes, he passed his finger downwards along the column of\n",
      "numbers. And immediately, as though in mockery of his scepticism,\n",
      "no further than the second line from the top, his eye was caught by\n",
      "the figure 9,499! Unable to believe his eyes, he hurriedly dropped\n",
      "the paper on his knees without looking to see the number of the\n",
      "ticket, and, just as though some one had given him a douche of cold\n",

      "And pictures came crowding on his imagination, each more gracious\n",
      "and poetical than the last. And in all these pictures he saw\n",
      "himself well-fed, serene, healthy, felt warm, even hot! Here, after\n",
      "eating a summer soup, cold as ice, he lay on his back on the\n",
      "burning sand close to a stream or in the garden under a lime-tree.\n",
      ". . . It is hot. . . . His little boy and girl are crawling about\n",
      "near him, digging in the sand or catching ladybirds in the grass.\n",
      "He dozes sweetly, thinking of nothing, and feeling all over that he\n",
      "need not go to the office today, tomorrow, or the day after. Or,\n",
      "tired of lying still, he goes to the hayfield, or to the forest for\n",
      "mushrooms, or watches the peasants catching fish with a net. When\n",
      "the sun sets he takes a towel and soap and saunters to the bathing\n",
      "shed, where he undresses at his leisure, slowly rubs his bare chest\n",
      "with his hands, and goes into the water. And in the water, near the\n",
      "opaque soapy circles, little fish flit to and fro and green\n",
      "water-weeds nod their heads. After bathing there is tea with cream\n",
      "and milk rolls. . . . In the evening a walk or vint with the\n",
      "neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it would be nice to buy an estate,\" said his wife, also\n",

      "\n",
      "Ivan Dmitritch pictured to himself autumn with its rains, its cold\n",
      "evenings, and its St. Martin's summer. At that season he would have\n",
      "to take longer walks about the garden and beside the river, so as\n",
      "to get thoroughly chilled, and then drink a big glass of vodka and\n",
      "eat a salted mushroom or a soused cucumber, and then--drink\n",
      "another. . . . The children would come running from the\n",
      "kitchen-garden, bringing a carrot and a radish smelling of fresh\n",
      "earth. . . . And then, he would lie stretched full length on the\n",
      "sofa, and in leisurely fashion turn over the pages of some\n",
      "illustrated magazine, or, covering his face with it and unbuttoning\n",
      "his waistcoat, give himself up to slumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "The St. Martin's summer is followed by cloudy, gloomy weather. It\n",
      "rains day and night, the bare trees weep, the wind is damp and\n",
      "cold. The dogs, the horses, the fowls--all are wet, depressed,\n",
      "downcast. There is nowhere to walk; one can't go out for days\n",
      "together; one has to pace up and down the room, looking\n",
      "despondently at the grey window. It is dreary!\n",
      "\n",
      "Ivan Dmitritch stopped and looked at his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should go abroad, you know, Masha,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he began thinking how nice it would be in late autumn to go\n",
      "abroad somewhere to the South of France ... to Italy ... to\n",
      "India!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should certainly go abroad too,\" his wife said. \"But look at the\n",
      "number of the ticket!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait, wait! ...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked about the room and went on thinking. It occurred to him:\n",
      "what if his wife really did go abroad? It is pleasant to travel\n",
      "alone, or in the society of light, careless women who live in the\n",
      "present, and not such as think and talk all the journey about\n",
      "nothing but their children, sigh, and tremble with dismay over\n",
      "every farthing. Ivan Dmitritch imagined his wife in the train with\n",
      "a multitude of parcels, baskets, and bags; she would be sighing\n",
      "over something, complaining that the train made her head ache, that\n",
      "she had spent so much money.... At the stations he would\n",
      "continually be having to run for boiling water, bread and butter.\n",
      "...She wouldn't have dinner because of its being too dear....\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She would begrudge me every farthing,\" he thought, with a glance\n",
      "at his wife. \"The lottery ticket is hers, not mine! Besides, what\n",
      "is the use of her going abroad? What does she want there? She would\n",
      "shut herself up in the hotel, and not let me out of her sight.... I know!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And for the first time in his life his mind dwelt on the fact that\n",
      "his wife had grown elderly and plain, and that she was saturated\n",
      "through and through with the smell of cooking, while he was still\n",
      "young, fresh, and healthy, and might well have got married again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, all that is silly nonsense,\" he thought; \"but...why\n",
      "should she go abroad? What would she make of it? And yet she would\n",
      "go, of course.... I can fancy.... In reality it is all one to\n",
      "her, whether it is Naples or Klin. She would only be in my way. I\n",
      "should be dependent upon her. I can fancy how, like a regular\n",
      "woman, she will lock the money up as soon as she gets it.... She\n",
      "will look after her relations and grudge me every farthing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ivan Dmitritch thought of her relations. All those wretched\n",
      "brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles would come crawling about\n",
      "as soon as they heard of the winning ticket, would begin whining\n",
      "like beggars, and fawning upon them with oily, hypocritical smiles.\n",
      "Wretched, detestable people! If they were given anything, they\n",
      "would ask for more; while if they were refused, they would swear at\n",
      "them, slander them, and wish them every kind of misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ivan Dmitritch remembered his own relations, and their faces, at\n",
      "which he had looked impartially in the past, struck him now as\n",
      "repulsive and hateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are such reptiles!\" he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "And his wife's face, too, struck him as repulsive and hateful.\n",
      "Anger surged up in his heart against her, and he thought\n",
      "malignantly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She knows nothing about money, and so she is stingy. If she won it\n",
      "she would give me a hundred roubles, and put the rest away under\n",
      "lock and key.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he looked at his wife, not with a smile now, but with hatred.\n",
      "She glanced at him too, and also with hatred and anger. She had her\n",
      "own daydreams, her own plans, her own reflections; she understood\n",
      "perfectly well what her husband's dreams were. She knew who would\n",
      "be the first to try to grab her winnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very nice making daydreams at other people's expense!\" is\n",
      "what her eyes expressed. \"No, don't you dare!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband understood her look; hatred began stirring again in his\n",
      "breast, and in order to annoy his wife he glanced quickly, to spite\n",
      "her at the fourth page on the newspaper and read out triumphantly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Series 9,499, number 46! Not 26!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hatred and hope both disappeared at once, and it began immediately\n",
      "to seem to Ivan Dmitritch and his wife that their rooms were dark\n",
      "and small and low-pitched, that the supper they had been eating was\n",
      "not doing them good, but Lying heavy on their stomachs, that the\n",
      "evenings were long and wearisome. . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the devil's the meaning of it?\" said Ivan Dmitritch,\n",

      "gave their opinions on spiritualism. None of them believed in\n",
      "spiritualism, but all admitted that there were many things in this\n",

      "room the literature master was explaining to the visitors the cases\n",
      "in which a sentry has the right to fire on passers-by. The\n",

      "other odors. On two tables the accessories, the drinks and light\n",
      "refreshments, were set out in artistic disorder. The cook, Marfa,\n",

      "Mrs. Brennen took snuff. She got it out of her grandson's store; going in and helping herself from the big tin on the second shelf. It was a habit her family deplored. Mrs. Brennen did not like snuff much. It was one of the things she had got over. It made her cough. But the fact that her family deplored her taking it prevented her from giving it up completely. She drank a little too. Not much; just enough to get \"tiddly.\" That was what she called it, \"I'm a little tiddly to-day,\" she'd say, and the family didn't like that either. Nor did she, save for the fun of shocking them and the interest outwitting them gave her.\n",
      "An old woman did not have much fun, and she had her reputation as a character to keep up. Sometimes she wished she was not a character.\n",
      "\"Mad,\" people called her behind her back; \"eccentric,\" to her face. \"Dear Mrs. Brennen, you would do that. You are so eccentric.\" \"Mad\" she would not agree to; \"eccentric,\" yes; if it was eccentric to like sitting on the stoep in the sun and only talking when you wanted to. There was too much talk in the world. Sometimes she would go for days without talking. \"One of her spells,\" they called it. Oh, yes, she knew what they said: \"Old Mrs. Brennen is having one of her spells.\" But she was too busy thinking to worry about what people thought. \"Let 'em talk,\" she said. \"If they'd seen what I've seen, they'd stay silent. If they'd seen what I've seen, they'd have something to think about. Lot of damned old women! That's what they are, men and all.\" Her family made her laugh with their goings-on. When they reached her age, if they ever did, they'd know that nothing mattered very much. She took another pinch of snuff. Some of it slipped between her fingers on to her black alpaca dress. She flicked it off with the back of her fingers and fumed to watch a span of oxen pull up to the store.\n",
      "The voorloper bent down to pick up some clods to throw into the faces of the oxen. The driver whistled and turned the handle of the brake. The big wheels locked, dragged on a yard or two and stopped. Taking off his hat, the driver went into the store. The voorloper sat in the dust under the horns of the leaders.\n",
      "Mrs. Brennen wondered how many wagons she had seen pull up like that since she had come to Brennen's Store as a bride. Thousands and thousands of wagons. Thousands of men, too--white men, Kaffirs, men on foot, in Cape carts, in spiders, or riding, and now they came in motor-cars. Mrs. Brennen did not like motor-cars. Of course they saved time. But what did one do with the time one saved? No one could tell her that. She chuckled. They couldn't tell her, because they didn't know.\n",
      "She had seen two wars and some native troubles. Once when Brennen was away, the store had been burned by Kaffirs. She had just escaped. A friendly native had warned her. She had hidden in the bush. She had taken Susie with her--a sweet little dog. She had never had another dog like Susie-black and white, as soft to touch as silk, with a wet pink nose. Generally, black-and-white dogs had black noses, but Susie's had been pink. As she crouched among the rocks, the Kaffirs had come quite near her. Susie had tried to bark and she had held her between her knees and strangled her. Then the Kaffirs had gone and she had buried Susie. The road had been moved since then, and the new store built. Susie was buried about where the wagon stood now. She looked at her hands. They were very frail, veined, knotted and lumpy with gout. Once they had been beautiful. Brennen had said she had beautiful hands. Once they had strangled a pet dog while wild Kaffirs swarmed round her.\n",
      "They were off-loading the wagon. Mealier. Her grandson, George, was buying them, then. He would pay too much for them. He always paid too much for everything. She thought of a horse he had bought once. That must have been twenty years ago. Like all horses said to be salted, it had died of horse sickness. She had told him it wasn't salted. Anyone could see it was not salted. A salted horse had a look. You couldn't explain it. You just knew the look it had.\n",
      "George came out of the store now. A stupid boy. He always had been stupid.\n",
      "\"Don't pay ten shillings a bag!\" she shouted. \"Don't pay more than eight; and sample them!\" If it wasn't for me, I don't believe he'd sample them, she thought. She watched him drive a knife with a hollow groove into the bags, emptying the pips into his hand. Some chickens ran out to pick up the fallen mealiest One of them picked a tick from the heel of the near wheeler--a big red and white ox that was chewing its cud.\n",
      "Mrs. Brennen closed her eyes. Sometimes they forgot who she was. Yes, sometimes they forgot that it was still her store. That she was Cecelia Brennen, the mother of them all. The mother of a multitude of fools. Children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren. It was hard to keep track of them now. Each year they came to show her the new babies they had bred. She thought of her first grandson. She had been so pleased with him. She looked at George; he had been the first grandson. He was leaning against the door of the store. Babies were like everything else; when there were so many of them, they became commonplace. It was hard to remember their names or even their mothers' names. She liked the Kaffir babies best--black like puppies, and pleasantly nameless. The Kaffir women who brought them to her to admire did not expect her to remember anything; all they wanted was a smile and a present. But that was what most people wanted, when you came to think of it--a smile and a present.\n",
      "She nodded her head. They thought her memory had gone; but she knew more than the whole pack of them put together. Knew everything that was worth remembering. Ninety-three, and the pattern of her life trailed out like a cloak behind her--her loves and hates, that had once been so hot and cold, all meaningless now--just part of the fabric; brilliant threads that had been woven through it. Remember--she remembered all right. The things she forgot, like the names of her great-grandchildren, and of the women her grandsons had married, were not important. What did it matter if she did not recognise them all, so long as they knew her? Besides, women all looked the same now. They had no character--short curly hair, red lips, red nails and no shape.\n",
      "She watched the wagon go. The driver shouted and clapped his whip. The voorloper trotted in front of the running oxen. The hind wheels were still locked, and dragged. That was like a Kaffir, to start his span with the brake on. The driver clapped his whip again and took off the brake, then he ran forward and jumped on to the disselboom. She remembered a man being brought into the store who had been run over that way. He had slipped and the wheels had gone over his legs. Empty of ballast, the wagon moved noisily. One wheel let out piercing squeaks. Grease, Mrs. Brennen thought. George should have noticed it and sold him some grease.\n",
      "She stared down the road. It was red, unmetalled, dusty, and wide enough to turn a span. Part of it was bordered with big blue gums; grey foliaged untidy trees whose bark hung in torn white ribbons from the trunks. There was the bottle store, the chemist's, the Standard Bank, the coolie store, and the usual white houses with red roofs that got smaller and more disreputable as the road went on. The best part of the dorp was behind her. That was where the doctor lived, and the bank manager, and Mr. Fairburn. No one knew quite what Mr. Fairburn did or where he got his money. That was where George wanted to live. He thought it was common to live opposite the store. He wanted to drive down to it in his new car each day, as if he was a professional man.\n",
      "She laughed. Perhaps that was it, or perhaps he wanted her tucked away safely where she could not see everything that went on. But the store was her life. It did not change, like the children. It did not die. It did not go away. It grew, but it grew slowly and precisely. You knew which way it was going to grow. Seventy years was a long time to sit in one place. She had been asked why she did not travel! Travel. Why go and look for life when it was going on all around you if you had eyes to see and waited long enough? She thought of the story of the two hunters. One had walked for miles, looking for game. The other had sat near a water-hole. The first had killed nothing. The second had taken what he wanted. It was better and less exhausting to let things come to you than to go and search for them. The store was like a water-hole--everyone had to come to it in the end. If they wanted a needle or a plough, they came to Brennen's.\n",
      "She saw a car. What a dust it threw up! It came from Pretoria. It was many years since she had been there. They said Church Square was now a garden. It had been the outspan. They had often outspanned there in the old days. Sometimes there had been two hundred wagons, Lying wheel to wheel. But the great days were gone, and where were the men to day who could compare with the men she had known then? Men like the old president, Joubert, De Wet, De la Rey, Cecil Rhodes, or Doctor Jim. Men like Brennen her husband. That was another reason she sat in the store all day. Brennen was with her. She could feel his company.\n",
      "She looked at George. He had not moved. George was fat. She hated fat men. A fat woman was comfortable, but a fat man an abomination.\n",
      "The car stopped at the store. A young man got out; he had a letter in his hand. He looked at the notice outside the store. Then he went up to George and gave him the letter. She would find out what was in it later. A man in a car bringing George a letter.\n",
      "George was bringing him over. He looked like an Englishman. There was even something familiar about him. The turn of his head or the way he walked.\n",
      "\"She may know,\" she heard George say, \"but she's difficult. She has spells.\"\n",
      "That was another of George's delusions--that she was deaf. She hated being shouted at, but it was worth letting them think it for the asides she heard.\n",
      "\"This is Mr. Vane,\" George said, putting his mouth to her ear. \"He has come from England, Ouma.\"\n",
      "She put out her hand. \"I can see he comes from England,\" she said. \"Look at his boots.\" Mrs. Brennen wondered if she would take snuff now or later. He seemed a nice young man, fresh complexioned, very clean and shiny, with reddish hair.\n",
      "\"Sit down,\" she said.\n",
      "He sat down.\n",
      "\"How much did you pay for those mealies, George?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"Nine shillings.\"\n",
      "He would go in a minute and leave her with the young man. George got up.\n",
      "\"I said you weren't to pay more than eight.\"\n",
      "She looked him up and down. Once she had had great hopes of George.\n",
      "\"I'II be going,\" George said. \"See you later.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" the Englishman said. \"I do hope I'm not being a nuisance, Mrs. Brennen.\"\n",
      "\"Nothing is a nuisance now,\" she said.\n",
      "She got her snuff-box. \"Take snuff?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"No, thank you.\"\n",
      "\"Quite right, young man. A filthy habit. He\"--she pointed to George's back--\"thinks I am a disgrace to the family.\" She chuckled. \"But I bred them. If it wasn't for me, there'd be no family--and the store is mine. That's what they don't like. They'd like to sell the store and go into something else--too grand for Brennen's general store. Ride round in motor-cars. That's what they want to do--just ride round and round. There's no sense in riding round and round.\" She looked at her visitor. He seemed a little bewildered. Never seen anyone like me before, she thought.\n",
      "\"Never seen anyone like me, have you?\" she asked. \"And you won't again, young man; I'm one of the last of them. Real people, we were. Men and women. Real,\" she said. She closed her eyes. \"What do you want?\" she asked. \"Why did you come here? Who gave you a letter to George? No good having a letter to George. He's a fool. He's my grandson, and I know.\"\n",
      "\"It's a long story.\" Francis Vane lit a cigarette. He wondered how to begin. \"It's my father,\" he said. \"You see, his father--my grandfather--was killed near here with the Three Hundred and First, and I wondered if anyone could tell me about it. They sent me to George Brennen. I had a letter to him.\"\n",
      "\"No good sending anyone to him,\" Mrs. Brennen said.\n",
      "\"Do you remember them coming here?\" Vane asked. \"It was in November 1880.\"\n",
      "\"Of course I remember,\" Mrs. Brennen said. \"John--that's George's father--was ill then. We thought he would die, and then they came. 'Kiss me Mother . . . kiss your darling daughter'--that's the tune they played as they marched in. They had a doctor with them--a Captain Bull. He saved John's life and we gave him a cage of wild birds. . . .  But what do you want to know? she asked.\n",
      "\"I want to know how it happened. You see, my grandfather commanded the Three Hundred and First. He was killed. They said it was his fault. That he was incompetent. My father is very old now and he broods about it. He wants to know where his father is buried. He wants to know what happened. He's very old,\" he said again.\n",
      "\"I'm very old,\" Mrs. Brennen said, \"and I know; I brood too. Thinking, I call it. Your grandfather. Then that's it. That's why I thought I'd seen you before. I danced with him that night. He danced well. We gave them a dance in the old store.\" She nodded to the warehouse behind the present building. \"We cleared everything out. Ploughs, harrows, soft goods and all. We put buck sails over them and gave the officers a dance. They had come from Lydenburg and were going to Pretoria. They didn't think there'd be a war. They said it would be a massacre if it came--Boars against trained troops like them. The Three Hundred and First,\" Mrs. Brennen said. \"Yes, the Three Hundred and First.\"\n",
      "Francis Vane leaned forward.\n",
      "Mrs. Brennen saw it all. She saw them march in. \"Kiss me, Mother . . . kiss your darling daughter.\" The drum-major tossed his stick, caught it, twirled it; men in red--an endless stream of sunburnt young men in red-mounted officers, rumbling transport, mules, baggage, wagons drawn by oxen, dogs that followed the battalion with lolling tongues.\n",
      "For a day Brennensdorp had been gay, populated with soldiers. They had swarmed everywhere--walking about in pairs, standing in groups, or lying on their backs in the shade of the gum trees--they had been small then and their shade thin. She saw them washing in buckets, their young chests bare, their hair wet, their eyes wrinkled against the soapy water. She had propped Johnny up so that he could see the soldiers. And it had been hot. It was not hot like that now. It had been so hot that the sheets of corrugated iron on the roof cracked as they pulled at the nails. The trees had danced up and down on the veld and the road was wet with mirage water. The red jackets of the troops had made it seem hotter. Wherever you looked there were red jackets. How they worked to empty the store! Everyone had helped. They had thrown mealie meal on the floor to make it fit for dancing.\n",
      "The colonel had come to thank her. \"Thank you, Mrs. Brennen,\" he had said. \"It is very kind of you to entertain us like this.\"\n",
      "Colonel Vane had admired her. She had seen it in his eyes. \"I hear your little boy is ill\" he said. \"Perhaps we can help you. Would you like to see Captain Bull, our doctor?\"\n",
      "She had seen him. A kindly man. He had come at once in his dusty boots. Brennen had given him beer. The bottles were kept cool in a canvas bucket that hung from the roof. \"I'll stay with him, Mrs. Brennen,\" the doctor said, and he had stayed watching at the bedside.\n",
      "The dance had been an event. Boys had been sent out to call in the countryside--all that were loyal, that is--and they had come, every man and woman and girl for miles round. Both sides of the street had been full of their Cape carts and buggies. The regimental band played tune after tune. The doorway was filled with watching Tommies. The dust and mealie flour had risen off the floor in clouds. It clung to the dresses of the girls, to the clothes and moustaches of the men. Music, laughter and some kissing.\n",
      "There was a tale she had heard about a clown who had made jokes while his little son was dying. She felt like that clown. She kept going in to look at Johnny. The doctor put his finger to his lips and motioned her away. She had gone away. . . .\n",
      "\"May I have the pleasure of this dance, Mrs. Brennen?\"\n",
      "\"Delighted.\"\n",
      "\"How well you dance, Mrs. Brennen.\"\n",
      "\"How light you are, Mrs. Brennen.\"\n",
      "What did they expect, she wondered. It was strange how one could go on saying and doing all the right things when one was feeling nothing. It was as if one stood some way off watching oneself. She had noticed this, time and again. That cannot be me. This cannot be me. Cecelia Brennen could not be doing this. But Cecelia Brennen was doing it. Her place was with her son; her place was at the dance. She was Mrs. Brennen, the wife of John Brennen, of Brennensdorp. It was her place to entertain the soldiers of the Queen.\n",
      "There had been a great killing of beasts and fowls, a great baking, a great emptying of casks of wine and brandy. She had seen to it all, and to her sick child as well. She had worn cyclamen taffeta with a bustle and hoops.\n",
      "Her hair hung in ringlets round her neck. A pretty young thing--the belle of the ball and the mother of a dying child. But he had not died. If only Johnny can grow up strong and healthy, like these officers, she thought. If only-- Excusing herself, she ran to see him. Captain Bull was asleep; the child slept, too, his hand in that of the soldier. How tired he looked!\n",
      "In the morning Johnny was better. \"He'll come through,\" the doctor said. He made up medicine for him in a whisky bottle. She and Brennen had wondered what they could give him. They could not give money. \"Give him my cage of birds,\" Johnny said. They were beautiful birds; little finks of every colour--rooibekkies, blouvinks, kingvinks. They were all tame, and sang and twittered on their perches. She had taken them to Captain Bull. \"A present from Johnny,\" she said. Brennen had come at that moment with a Kaffir carrying a case of champagne. The champagne and the birds had been stowed in the doctor's cart. The case of wine on the bed, and the cage slung from the roof and lashed to the sides, so that it should not swing.\n",
      "\"Good morning, Mrs. Brennen.\" Colonel Vane rode up. \"I am glad to hear your little boy is better.\"\n",
      "Behind the colonel there was a donkey wagon loaded with yellow peaches. It had just come in and the soldiers were crowded round it, eating peaches and stuffing them into their haversacks to eat on the march. The colonel was laughing.\n",
      "\"Fruit's good for them,\" he said.\n",
      "\"It's a good year for peaches. And the trees in the district are weighed down with them,\" she said.\n",
      "Then the bugles sounded. The colour-sergeants shouted, \"Fall in.\" The markers were waiting. The men, fully accoutre, ruddy with sleep, ran out. Transport drivers cursed as their hubs bumped. The Three Hundred and First was going. They had come and they were going.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\"Kiss me, Mother . . . kiss your darling daughter\"--the band struck up again. Like a red snake the regiment swung out of the dorp in a cloud of dust. Then the dust fell. To-night they would lie in Pretoria.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "\n",
      "The Three Hundred and First had gone and Johnny would get well. She was sitting with Johnny when it happened. A man came galloping down the street. A private soldier, wounded, riding an officer's charger. It was streaked with sweat, its chest splashed with foam, its eyes were wild. She recognised the horse. It was Colonel Vane's horse. The big bay she had patted as he said good-bye.\n",
      "The soldier pulled up and almost fell from the saddle.\n",
      "\"What is it?\" she said. \"Oh, what is it?\" She knelt beside him in the dust.\n",
      "\"The doctor sent me to get help! They are all finished!\" he said. \"They're cut to hell--the whole bloody lot! We walked into it! The colonel's dead! I took his horse!\" He began to cry. \"They got us--they got us fair! It was murder!\"\n",
      "He was only a boy. She held him in her arms and the blood from the wound in his neck ran on to her shoulder. Suddenly he sat up. \"Bandages,\" he said, \"and brandy . . . and food! That's what the doctor said! We've got no bandages! They're all bleeding, and nothing to stop it! Oh, God, Mrs. Brennen, nothing to stop it! I must get back!\" He dragged the horse towards him and tried to mount.\n",
      "\"What are you going to do?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"I don't know, but I must go back. I can't stay here.\"\n",
      "\"Where is it? Where did it happen?\"\n",
      "\"At the little river--they were all round us.\"\n",
      "\"The Spruit?\"\n",
      "\"That's what they call it.\"\n",
      "Brennen was inspanning already, loading up the Cape cart. That would be the quickest; the wagons could follow. It was not very far. She ran into the house for sheets, towels, bedding, mattresses, blankets, brandy; the house and store were emptied of everything that might be useful.\n",
      "She climbed into the cart beside her husband. He had put in four horses instead of two.\n",
      "\"Trot the oxen, Jan!\" he shouted to the driver who was inspanning.\n",
      "\"They cannot trot so far, baas!\"\n",
      "\"Trot them and be damned!\" Brennen said.\n",
      "And then they were off at a gallop, rocking first on one wheel and then on the other as they hit the bumps in the road. Hardly checking for the drift, they splashed through the water. Brennen hit the horses as they slowed up to pull out of it. She had never seen him hit a horse before. They sprang into the traces again with such a jerk that she thought the swingletree would break loose. She looked at the pole. Brennen had tied it with a double riem. They were on the flat now. The horses were bolting. Let them bolt. Nothing could go wrong with a strong cart and good gear on a straight road unless one of the horses fell. The whip clapped like a pistol as Brennen urged them to greater speed. The four reins were like live things in his hands as he cried out the horses' names: \"Bles! Charlie! Klinkie! Chaka!\" Chaka was a new black horse. Brennen had put him on the off lead, where he could get at him best with his whip. \"Come, Bles! . . . Come, Charlie!\" She gripped the arms of her chair. What a drive it had been. She smelt the dust in her nostrils.\n",
      "The road was always dusty, but now it had been made worse by the passing of a thousand men and their transport. The dust rose in clouds, obliterating everything, so that sometimes she could see only the horses' ears and their tossing manes. The reins went down to nothing. They disappeared into the dust. She could see no road. That they kept on it was a miracle.\n",
      "And then they got there. The horses shied and pulled across the road as the leaders almost ran into an overturned wagon.\n",
      "The dust fell slowly.\n",
      "\"You've come.\" It was the boy on the colonel's horse. \"I was coming back to find you,\" he said.\n",
      "They got out of the cart. Some soldiers took the horses out. She saw it all--the undulating ground, the bush, the trees by the road--many of them scored by bullets. There was blood everywhere. It ran down the sloping road into pools.\n",
      "They helped the doctor to move the men, to bandage, to cut more bandages. Tents were pitched, food cooked, great cauldrons of hot water got ready to dress the wounded. She had gone in to Colonel Vane. His legs were off. While she was with him, Frantz Joubert, the Boer commandant, had come in.\n",
      "\"Will you drink with me, Commandant?\" the colonel said. \"And you, too, Mrs. Brennen.\" It was the champagne her husband had given the doctor. They drank. Joubert said, \"Here's to Queen Victoria. May she live long and take her soldiers from the Transvaal.\"\n",
      "They had wrapped the dead in blankets and buried them where they fell along the side of the road, on the veld where they had taken up their positions. Beside almost every body there were peaches; they had fallen from the hands of the men as they were ambushed. Their pipe-clayed haversacks still bulged with them. The dead of the Three Hundred and First were buried with their peaches where they lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tShe saw Johnny's cage of birds. It was broken and the birds were free. The wild birds were free once more and the men were dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\"Yes,\" she said, looking up, \"that's what happened to the Three Hundred and First. The birds were free and the men were dead, and buried where they fell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But--\" Vane said.\n",
      "She had not spoken. She had sat for nearly half an hour with her head sunk on her breast.\n",
      "She looked accusingly at her grandson. \"And they think I can't remember. I can remember everything. I can even remember the names.\"\n",
      "\"That's what I was afraid of,\" George Brennen said--\"one of her spells.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThey were silent, staring at the old woman; her head was lowered again.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, from the next house, a woman screamed at a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't I tell you not to eat so many peaches? Peaches--you guzzle peaches all day, and then bring them home at night, so that you can eat more. You'll be sick, I say. Where did you get them? Did you steal them?\"\n",
      "\"I didn't steal them, Mother. They're the soldiers' peaches. We drove ova there to get them. They're wild peaches.\" The child was crying.\n",
      "Mrs. Brennen got up. \"Let her have the peaches. Let her have all she wants. The soldiers' peaches never hurt anyone.\" Mrs. Brennen sat down again. \"The soldiers' peaches,\" she said--\"that grew out of their pockets.\"\n",
      "Tears ran down her cheeks. They followed the lines of her face and dripped on to the snuff-stained alpaca dress. She made no effort to stay them.\n",
      "\"Out of their pockets?\" Vane said.\n",
      "\"She means their haversacks.\"\n",
      "\"Then there are peach trees?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, there are trees--plenty of them.\"\n",
      "\"And they buried them where they fell? Do you know the place well?\" Vane asked.\n",
      "\"Everyone knows it well. All the children get peaches from them. They grow like this.\" George Brennen traced a pattern on the dust of the stoep with his finger. \"Here is where there are the most. . . .  That was where the main body got it. . . .  They were buried on both sides of the road . . . and out here is where the scouts fell.'' He made scattered dots.\n",
      "\"Then there were scouts out,\" Vane said. \"And it wasn't my grandfather's fault.\"\n",
      "\"It was nobody's fault,\" Brennen said. \"The Boers were hidden and they held their fire.\"\n",
      "Vane laughed. \"Can we go over there to-morrow?\" he asked. \"I'll make a map of it for my father. Poor father,\" he said. \"If only he had known this years ago! He nearly came once, and then he was afraid to come--afraid of what he'd find.\"\n",
      "\"We call them the soldiers' peaches,\" George Brennen said. \"And I wish she had told you the story--I have heard it hundreds of times--but she's old; she has spells.\"\n",
      "His grandmother looked up. \"I remember as well as anyone,\" she said. She pointed to Vane. \"I remember his grandfather. A fine man. There were some fine men in those days.\"\n",
      "Brennen took Vane's shoulder. \"Come along to my place. Spend the night and we'll drive over there to-morrow.\"\n",

      "\"OFF THERE to the right--somewhere--is a large island,\" said Whitney.\" It's rather a mystery--\"\n",
      "\"What island is it?\" Rainsford asked.\n",
      "\"The old charts call it 'Ship-Trap Island,\"' Whitney replied.\"  A suggestive name, isn't it? Sailors have a curious dread of the place. I don't know why. Some superstition--\"\n",
      "\"Can't see it,\" remarked Rainsford, trying to peer through the dank tropical night that was palpable as it pressed its thick warm blackness in upon the yacht.\n",
      "\"You've good eyes,\" said Whitney, with a laugh,\" and I've seen you pick off a moose moving in the brown fall bush at four hundred yards, but even you can't see four miles or so through a moonless Caribbean night.\"\n",
      "\"Nor four yards,\" admitted Rainsford. \"Ugh! It's like moist black velvet.\"\n",
      "\"It will be light enough in Rio,\" promised Whitney. \"We should make it in a few days. I hope the jaguar guns have come from Purdey's. We should have some good hunting up the Amazon. Great sport, hunting.\"\n",
      "\"The best sport in the world,\" agreed Rainsford.\n",
      "\"For the hunter,\" amended Whitney. \"Not for the jaguar.\"\n",
      "\"Don't talk rot, Whitney,\" said Rainsford. \"You're a big-game hunter, not a philosopher. Who cares how a jaguar feels?\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps the jaguar does,\" observed Whitney.\n",
      "\"Bah! They've no understanding.\"\n",
      "\"Even so, I rather think they understand one thing--fear. The fear of pain and the fear of death.\"\n",
      "\"Nonsense,\" laughed Rainsford. \"This hot weather is making you soft, Whitney. Be a realist. The world is made up of two classes--the hunters and the huntees. Luckily, you and I are hunters. Do you think we've passed that island yet?\"\n",
      "\"I can't tell in the dark. I hope so.\"\n",
      "\"Why? \" asked Rainsford.\n",
      "\"The place has a reputation--a bad one.\"\n",
      "\"Cannibals?\" suggested Rainsford.\n",
      "\"Hardly. Even cannibals wouldn't live in such a God-forsaken place. But it's gotten into sailor lore, somehow. Didn't you notice that the crew's nerves seemed a bit jumpy today?\"\n",
      "\"They were a bit strange, now you mention it. Even Captain Nielsen--\"\n",
      "\"Yes, even that tough-minded old Swede, who'd go up to the devil himself and ask him for a light. Those fishy blue eyes held a look I never saw there before. All I could get out of him was 'This place has an evil name among seafaring men, sir.' Then he said to me, very gravely, 'Don't you feel anything?'--as if the air about us was actually poisonous. Now, you mustn't laugh when I tell you this--I did feel something like a sudden chill.\n",
      "\"There was no breeze. The sea was as flat as a plate-glass window. We were drawing near the island then. What I felt was a--a mental chill; a sort of sudden dread.\"\n",
      "\"Pure imagination,\" said Rainsford.\n",
      "\"One superstitious sailor can taint the whole ship's company with his fear.\"\n",
      "\"Maybe. But sometimes I think sailors have an extra sense that tells them when they are in danger. Sometimes I think evil is a tangible thing--with wave lengths, just as sound and light have. An evil place can, so to speak, broadcast vibrations of evil. Anyhow, I'm glad we're getting out of this zone. Well, I think I'll turn in now, Rainsford.\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sleepy,\" said Rainsford. \"I'm going to smoke another pipe up on the afterdeck.\"\n",
      "\"Good night, then, Rainsford. See you at breakfast.\"\n",
      "\"Right. Good night, Whitney.\"\n",
      "There was no sound in the night as Rainsford sat there but the muffled throb of the engine that drove the yacht swiftly through the darkness, and the swish and ripple of the wash of the propeller.\n",
      "Rainsford, reclining in a steamer chair, indolently puffed on his favorite brier. The sensuous drowsiness of the night was on him.\" It's so dark,\" he thought, \"that I could sleep without closing my eyes; the night would be my eyelids--\"\n",
      "An abrupt sound startled him. Off to the right he heard it, and his ears, expert in such matters, could not be mistaken. Again he heard the sound, and again. Somewhere, off in the blackness, someone had fired a gun three times.\n",
      "Rainsford sprang up and moved quickly to the rail, mystified. He strained his eyes in the direction from which the reports had come, but it was like trying to see through a blanket. He leaped upon the rail and balanced himself there, to get greater elevation; his pipe, striking a rope, was knocked from his mouth. He lunged for it; a short, hoarse cry came from his lips as he realized he had reached too far and had lost his balance. The cry was pinched off short as the blood-warm waters of the Caribbean Sea dosed over his head.\n",
      "He struggled up to the surface and tried to cry out, but the wash from the speeding yacht slapped him in the face and the salt water in his open mouth made him gag and strangle. Desperately he struck out with strong strokes after the receding lights of the yacht, but he stopped before he had swum fifty feet. A certain coolheadedness had come to him; it was not the first time he had been in a tight place. There was a chance that his cries could be heard by someone aboard the yacht, but that chance was slender and grew more slender as the yacht raced on. He wrestled himself out of his clothes and shouted with all his power. The lights of the yacht became faint and ever-vanishing fireflies; then they were blotted out entirely by the night.\n",
      "Rainsford remembered the shots. They had come from the right, and doggedly he swam in that direction, swimming with slow, deliberate strokes, conserving his strength. For a seemingly endless time he fought the sea. He began to count his strokes; he could do possibly a hundred more and then--\n",
      "Rainsford heard a sound. It came out of the darkness, a high screaming sound, the sound of an animal in an extremity of anguish and terror.\n",
      "He did not recognize the animal that made the sound; he did not try to; with fresh vitality he swam toward the sound. He heard it again; then it was cut short by another noise, crisp, staccato.\n",
      "\"Pistol shot,\" muttered Rainsford, swimming on.\n",
      "Ten minutes of determined effort brought another sound to his ears--the most welcome he had ever heard--the muttering and growling of the sea breaking on a rocky shore. He was almost on the rocks before he saw them; on a night less calm he would have been shattered against them. With his remaining strength he dragged himself from the swirling waters. Jagged crags appeared to jut up into the opaqueness; he forced himself upward, hand over hand. Gasping, his hands raw, he reached a flat place at the top. Dense jungle came down to the very edge of the cliffs. What perils that tangle of trees and underbrush might hold for him did not concern Rainsford just then. All he knew was that he was safe from his enemy, the sea, and that utter weariness was on him. He flung himself down at the jungle edge and tumbled headlong into the deepest sleep of his life.\n",
      "When he opened his eyes he knew from the position of the sun that it was late in the afternoon. Sleep had given him new vigor; a sharp hunger was picking at him. He looked about him, almost cheerfully.\n",
      "\"Where there are pistol shots, there are men. Where there are men, there is food,\" he thought. But what kind of men, he wondered, in so forbidding a place? An unbroken front of snarled and ragged jungle fringed the shore.\n",
      "He saw no sign of a trail through the closely knit web of weeds and trees; it was easier to go along the shore, and Rainsford floundered along by the water. Not far from where he landed, he stopped.\n",
      "Some wounded thing--by the evidence, a large animal--had thrashed about in the underbrush; the jungle weeds were crushed down and the moss was lacerated; one patch of weeds was stained crimson. A small, glittering object not far away caught Rainsford's eye and he picked it up. It was an empty cartridge.\n",
      "\"A twenty-two,\" he remarked. \"That's odd. It must have been a fairly large animal too. The hunter had his nerve with him to tackle it with a light gun. It's clear that the brute put up a fight. I suppose the first three shots I heard was when the hunter flushed his quarry and wounded it. The last shot was when he trailed it here and finished it.\"\n",
      "He examined the ground closely and found what he had hoped to find--the print of hunting boots. They pointed along the cliff in the direction he had been going. Eagerly he hurried along, now slipping on a rotten log or a loose stone, but making headway; night was beginning to settle down on the island.\n",
      "Bleak darkness was blacking out the sea and jungle when Rainsford sighted the lights. He came upon them as he turned a crook in the coast line; and his first thought was that be had come upon a village, for there were many lights. But as he forged along he saw to his great astonishment that all the lights were in one enormous building--a lofty structure with pointed towers plunging upward into the gloom. His eyes made out the shadowy outlines of a palatial chateau; it was set on a high bluff, and on three sides of it cliffs dived down to where the sea licked greedy lips in the shadows.\n",
      "\"Mirage,\" thought Rainsford. But it was no mirage, he found, when he opened the tall spiked iron gate. The stone steps were real enough; the massive door with a leering gargoyle for a knocker was real enough; yet above it all hung an air of unreality.\n",
      "He lifted the knocker, and it creaked up stiffly, as if it had never before been used. He let it fall, and it startled him with its booming loudness. He thought he heard steps within; the door remained closed. Again Rainsford lifted the heavy knocker, and let it fall. The door opened then--opened as suddenly as if it were on a spring--and Rainsford stood blinking in the river of glaring gold light that poured out. The first thing Rainsford's eyes discerned was the largest man Rainsford had ever seen--a gigantic creature, solidly made and black bearded to the waist. In his hand the man held a long-barreled revolver, and he was pointing it straight at Rainsford's heart.\n",
      "Out of the snarl of beard two small eyes regarded Rainsford.\n",
      "\"Don't be alarmed,\" said Rainsford, with a smile which he hoped was disarming. \"I'm no robber. I fell off a yacht. My name is Sanger Rainsford of New York City.\"\n",
      "The menacing look in the eyes did not change. The revolver pointing as rigidly as if the giant were a statue. He gave no sign that he understood Rainsford's words, or that he had even heard them. He was dressed in uniform--a black uniform trimmed with gray astrakhan.\n",
      "\"I'm Sanger Rainsford of New York,\" Rainsford began again. \"I fell off a yacht. I am hungry.\"\n",
      "The man's only answer was to raise with his thumb the hammer of his revolver. Then Rainsford saw the man's free hand go to his forehead in a military salute, and he saw him click his heels together and stand at attention. Another man was coming down the broad marble steps, an erect, slender man in evening clothes. He advanced to Rainsford and held out his hand.\n",
      "In a cultivated voice marked by a slight accent that gave it added precision and deliberateness, he said, \"It is a very great pleasure and honor to welcome Mr. Sanger Rainsford, the celebrated hunter, to my home.\"\n",
      "Automatically Rainsford shook the man's hand.\n",
      "\"I've read your book about hunting snow leopards in Tibet, you see,\" explained the man. \"I am General Zaroff.\"\n",
      "Rainsford's first impression was that the man was singularly handsome; his second was that there was an original, almost bizarre quality about the general's face. He was a tall man past middle age, for his hair was a vivid white; but his thick eyebrows and pointed military mustache were as black as the night from which Rainsford had come. His eyes, too, were black and very bright. He had high cheekbones, a sharpcut nose, a spare, dark face--the face of a man used to giving orders, the face of an aristocrat. Turning to the giant in uniform, the general made a sign. The giant put away his pistol, saluted, withdrew.\n",
      "\"Ivan is an incredibly strong fellow,\" remarked the general, \"but he has the misfortune to be deaf and dumb. A simple fellow, but, I'm afraid, like all his race, a bit of a savage.\"\n",
      "\"Is he Russian?\"\n",
      "\"He is a Cossack,\" said the general, and his smile showed red lips and pointed teeth. \"So am I.\"\n",
      "\"Come,\" he said, \"we shouldn't be chatting here. We can talk later. Now you want clothes, food, rest. You shall have them. This is a most-restful spot.\"\n",
      "Ivan had reappeared, and the general spoke to him with lips that moved but gave forth no sound.\n",
      "\"Follow Ivan, if you please, Mr. Rainsford,\" said the general. \"I was about to have my dinner when you came. I'll wait for you. You'll find that my clothes will fit you, I think.\"\n",
      "It was to a huge, beam-ceilinged bedroom with a canopied bed big enough for six men that Rainsford followed the silent giant. Ivan laid out an evening suit, and Rainsford, as he put it on, noticed that it came from a London tailor who ordinarily cut and sewed for none below the rank of duke.\n",
      "The dining room to which Ivan conducted him was in many ways remarkable. There was a medieval magnificence about it; it suggested a baronial hall of feudal times with its oaken panels, its high ceiling, its vast refectory tables where twoscore men could sit down to eat. About the hall were mounted heads of many animals--lions, tigers, elephants, moose, bears; larger or more perfect specimens Rainsford had never seen. At the great table the general was sitting, alone.\n",
      "\"You'll have a cocktail, Mr. Rainsford,\" he suggested. The cocktail was surpassingly good; and, Rainsford noted, the table apointments were of the finest--the linen, the crystal, the silver, the china.\n",
      "They were eating borsch, the rich, red soup with whipped cream so dear to Russian palates. Half apologetically General Zaroff said, \"We do our best to preserve the amenities of civilization here. Please forgive any lapses. We are well off the beaten track, you know. Do you think the champagne has suffered from its long ocean trip?\"\n",
      "\"Not in the least,\" declared Rainsford. He was finding the general a most thoughtful and affable host, a true cosmopolite. But there was one small trait of the general's that made Rainsford uncomfortable. Whenever he looked up from his plate he found the general studying him, appraising him narrowly.\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said General Zaroff, \"you were surprised that I recognized your name. You see, I read all books on hunting published in English, French, and Russian. I have but one passion in my life, Mr. Rainsford, and it is the hunt.\"\n",
      "\"You have some wonderful heads here,\" said Rainsford as he ate a particularly well-cooked filet mignon. \" That Cape buffalo is the largest I ever saw.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, that fellow. Yes, he was a monster.\"\n",
      "\"Did he charge you?\"\n",
      "\"Hurled me against a tree,\" said the general. \"Fractured my skull. But I got the brute.\"\n",
      "\"I've always thought,\" said Rainsford, \"that the Cape buffalo is the most dangerous of all big game.\"\n",
      "For a moment the general did not reply; he was smiling his curious red-lipped smile. Then he said slowly, \"No. You are wrong, sir. The Cape buffalo is not the most dangerous big game.\" He sipped his wine. \"Here in my preserve on this island,\" he said in the same slow tone, \"I hunt more dangerous game.\"\n",
      "Rainsford expressed his surprise. \"Is there big game on this island?\"\n",
      "The general nodded. \"The biggest.\"\n",
      "\"Really?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, it isn't here naturally, of course. I have to stock the island.\"\n",
      "\"What have you imported, general?\" Rainsford asked. \"Tigers?\"\n",
      "The general smiled. \"No,\" he said. \"Hunting tigers ceased to interest me some years ago. I exhausted their possibilities, you see. No thrill left in tigers, no real danger. I live for danger, Mr. Rainsford.\"\n",
      "The general took from his pocket a gold cigarette case and offered his guest a long black cigarette with a silver tip; it was perfumed and gave off a smell like incense.\n",
      "\"We will have some capital hunting, you and I,\" said the general. \"I shall be most glad to have your society.\"\n",
      "\"But what game--\" began Rainsford.\n",
      "\"I'll tell you,\" said the general. \"You will be amused, I know. I think I may say, in all modesty, that I have done a rare thing. I have invented a new sensation. May I pour you another glass of port?\"\n",
      "\"Thank you, general.\"\n",
      "The general filled both glasses, and said, \"God makes some men poets. Some He makes kings, some beggars. Me He made a hunter. My hand was made for the trigger, my father said. He was a very rich man with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and he was an ardent sportsman. When I was only five years old he gave me a little gun, specially made in Moscow for me, to shoot sparrows with. When I shot some of his prize turkeys with it, he did not punish me; he complimented me on my marksmanship. I killed my first bear in the Caucasus when I was ten. My whole life has been one prolonged hunt. I went into the army--it was expected of noblemen's sons--and for a time commanded a division of Cossack cavalry, but my real interest was always the hunt. I have hunted every kind of game in every land. It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.\"\n",
      "The general puffed at his cigarette.\n",
      "\"After the debacle in Russia I left the country, for it was imprudent for an officer of the Czar to stay there. Many noble Russians lost everything. I, luckily, had invested heavily in American securities, so I shall never have to open a tearoom in Monte Carlo or drive a taxi in Paris. Naturally, I continued to hunt--grizzlies in your Rockies, crocodiles in the Ganges, rhinoceroses in East Africa. It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo hit me and laid me up for six months. As soon as I recovered I started for the Amazon to hunt jaguars, for I had heard they were unusually cunning. They weren't.\" The Cossack sighed. \"They were no match at all for a hunter with his wits about him, and a high-powered rifle. I was bitterly disappointed. I was lying in my tent with a splitting headache one night when a terrible thought pushed its way into my mind. Hunting was beginning to bore me! And hunting, remember, had been my life. I have heard that in America businessmen often go to pieces when they give up the business that has been their life.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, that's so,\" said Rainsford.\n",
      "The general smiled. \"I had no wish to go to pieces,\" he said. \"I must do something. Now, mine is an analytical mind, Mr. Rainsford. Doubtless that is why I enjoy the problems of the chase.\"\n",
      "\"No doubt, General Zaroff.\"\n",
      "\"So,\" continued the general, \"I asked myself why the hunt no longer fascinated me. You are much younger than I am, Mr. Rainsford, and have not hunted as much, but you perhaps can guess the answer.\"\n",
      "\"What was it?\"\n",
      "\"Simply this: hunting had ceased to be what you call 'a sporting proposition.' It had become too easy. I always got my quarry. Always. There is no greater bore than perfection.\"\n",
      "The general lit a fresh cigarette.\n",
      "\"No animal had a chance with me any more. That is no boast; it is a mathematical certainty. The animal had nothing but his legs and his instinct. Instinct is no match for reason. When I thought of this it was a tragic moment for me, I can tell you.\"\n",
      "Rainsford leaned across the table, absorbed in what his host was saying.\n",
      "\"It came to me as an inspiration what I must do,\" the general went on.\n",
      "\"And that was?\"\n",
      "The general smiled the quiet smile of one who has faced an obstacle and surmounted it with success. \"I had to invent a new animal to hunt,\" he said.\n",
      "\"A new animal? You're joking.\"\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" said the general. \"I never joke about hunting. I needed a new animal. I found one. So I bought this island built this house, and here I do my hunting. The island is perfect for my purposes--there are jungles with a maze of traits in them, hills, swamps--\"\n",
      "\"But the animal, General Zaroff?\"\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the general, \"it supplies me with the most exciting hunting in the world. No other hunting compares with it for an instant. Every day I hunt, and I never grow bored now, for I have a quarry with which I can match my wits.\"\n",
      "Rainsford's bewilderment showed in his face.\n",
      "\"I wanted the ideal animal to hunt,\" explained the general. \"So I said, 'What are the attributes of an ideal quarry?' And the answer was, of course, 'It must have courage, cunning, and, above all, it must be able to reason.\"'\n",
      "\"But no animal can reason,\" objected Rainsford.\n",
      "\"My dear fellow,\" said the general, \"there is one that can.\"\n",
      "\"But you can't mean--\" gasped Rainsford.\n",
      "\"And why not?\"\n",
      "\"I can't believe you are serious, General Zaroff. This is a grisly joke.\"\n",
      "\"Why should I not be serious? I am speaking of hunting.\"\n",
      "\"Hunting? Great Guns, General Zaroff, what you speak of is murder.\"\n",
      "The general laughed with entire good nature. He regarded Rainsford quizzically. \"I refuse to believe that so modern and civilized a young man as you seem to be harbors romantic ideas about the value of human life. Surely your experiences in the war--\"\n",
      "\"Did not make me condone cold-blooded murder,\" finished Rainsford stiffly.\n",
      "Laughter shook the general. \"How extraordinarily droll you are!\" he said. \"One does not expect nowadays to find a young man of the educated class, even in America, with such a naïve, and, if I may say so, mid-Victorian point of view. It's like finding a snuffbox in a limousine. Ah, well, doubtless you had Puritan ancestors. So many Americans appear to have had. I'll wager you'll forget your notions when you go hunting with me. You've a genuine new thrill in store for you, Mr. Rainsford.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you, I'm a hunter, not a murderer.\"\n",
      "\"Dear me,\" said the general, quite unruffled, \"again that unpleasant word. But I think I can show you that your scruples are quite ill founded.\"\n",
      "\"Yes?\"\n",
      "\"Life is for the strong, to be lived by the strong, and, if needs be, taken by the strong. The weak of the world were put here to give the strong pleasure. I am strong. Why should I not use my gift? If I wish to hunt, why should I not? I hunt the scum of the earth: sailors from tramp ships--lassars, blacks, Chinese, whites, mongrels--a thoroughbred horse or hound is worth more than a score of them.\"\n",
      "\"But they are men,\" said Rainsford hotly.\n",
      "\"Precisely,\" said the general. \"That is why I use them. It gives me pleasure. They can reason, after a fashion. So they are dangerous.\"\n",
      "\"But where do you get them?\"\n",
      "The general's left eyelid fluttered down in a wink. \"This island is called Ship Trap,\" he answered. \"Sometimes an angry god of the high seas sends them to me. Sometimes, when Providence is not so kind, I help Providence a bit. Come to the window with me.\"\n",
      "Rainsford went to the window and looked out toward the sea.\n",
      "\"Watch! Out there!\" exclaimed the general, pointing into the night. Rainsford's eyes saw only blackness, and then, as the general pressed a button, far out to sea Rainsford saw the flash of lights.\n",
      "The general chuckled. \"They indicate a channel,\" he said, \"where there's none; giant rocks with razor edges crouch like a sea monster with wide-open jaws. They can crush a ship as easily as I crush this nut.\" He dropped a walnut on the hardwood floor and brought his heel grinding down on it. \"Oh, yes,\" he said, casually, as if in answer to a question, \"I have electricity. We try to be civilized here.\"\n",
      "\"Civilized? And you shoot down men?\"\n",
      "A trace of anger was in the general's black eyes, but it was there for but a second; and he said, in his most pleasant manner, \"Dear me, what a righteous young man you are! I assure you I do not do the thing you suggest. That would be barbarous. I treat these visitors with every consideration. They get plenty of good food and exercise. They get into splendid physical condition. You shall see for yourself tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"We'll visit my training school,\" smiled the general. \"It's in the cellar. I have about a dozen pupils down there now. They're from the Spanish bark San Lucar that had the bad luck to go on the rocks out there. A very inferior lot, I regret to say. Poor specimens and more accustomed to the deck than to the jungle.\"  He raised his hand, and Ivan, who served as waiter, brought thick Turkish coffee. Rainsford, with an effort, held his tongue in check.\n",
      "\"It's a game, you see,\" pursued the general blandly. \"I suggest to one of them that we go hunting. I give him a supply of food and an excellent hunting knife. I give him three hours' start. I am to follow, armed only with a pistol of the smallest caliber and range. If my quarry eludes me for three whole days, he wins the game. If I find him \"--the general smiled--\" he loses.\"\n",
      "\"Suppose he refuses to be hunted?\"\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the general, \"I give him his option, of course. He need not play that game if he doesn't wish to. If he does not wish to hunt, I turn him over to Ivan. Ivan once had the honor of serving as official knouter to the Great White Czar, and he has his own ideas of sport. Invariably, Mr. Rainsford, invariably they choose the hunt.\"\n",
      "\"And if they win?\"\n",
      "The smile on the general's face widened. \"To date I have not lost,\" he said. Then he added, hastily: \"I don't wish you to think me a braggart, Mr. Rainsford. Many of them afford only the most elementary sort of problem. Occasionally I strike a tartar. One almost did win. I eventually had to use the dogs.\"\n",
      "\"The dogs?\"\n",
      "\"This way, please. I'll show you.\"\n",
      "The general steered Rainsford to a window. The lights from the windows sent a flickering illumination that made grotesque patterns on the courtyard below, and Rainsford could see moving about there a dozen or so huge black shapes; as they turned toward him, their eyes glittered greenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A rather good lot, I think,\" observed the general. \"They are let out at seven every night. If anyone should try to get into my house--or out of it--something extremely regrettable would occur to him.\" He hummed a snatch of song from the Folies Bergere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now,\" said the general, \"I want to show you my new collection of heads. Will you come with me to the library?\"\n",
      "\"I hope,\" said Rainsford, \"that you will excuse me tonight, General Zaroff. I'm really not feeling well.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, indeed?\" the general inquired solicitously. \"Well, I suppose that's only natural, after your long swim. You need a good, restful night's sleep. Tomorrow you'll feel like a new man, I'll wager. Then we'll hunt, eh? I've one rather promising prospect--\" Rainsford was hurrying from the room.\n",
      "\"Sorry you can't go with me tonight,\" called the general. \"I expect rather fair sport--a big, strong, black. He looks resourceful--Well, good night, Mr. Rainsford; I hope you have a good night's rest.\"\n",
      "The bed was good, and the pajamas of the softest silk, and he was tired in every fiber of his being, but nevertheless Rainsford could not quiet his brain with the opiate of sleep. He lay, eyes wide open. Once he thought he heard stealthy steps in the corridor outside his room. He sought to throw open the door; it would not open. He went to the window and looked out. His room was high up in one of the towers. The lights of the chateau were out now, and it was dark and silent; but there was a fragment of sallow moon, and by its wan light he could see, dimly, the courtyard. There, weaving in and out in the pattern of shadow, were black, noiseless forms; the hounds heard him at the window and looked up, expectantly, with their green eyes. Rainsford went back to the bed and lay down. By many methods he tried to put himself to sleep. He had achieved a doze when, just as morning began to come, he heard, far off in the jungle, the faint report of a pistol.\n",
      "General Zaroff did not appear until luncheon. He was dressed faultlessly in the tweeds of a country squire. He was solicitous about the state of Rainsford's health.\n",
      "\"As for me,\" sighed the general, \"I do not feel so well. I am worried, Mr. Rainsford. Last night I detected traces of my old complaint.\"\n",
      "To Rainsford's questioning glance the general said, \"Ennui. Boredom.\"\n",
      "Then, taking a second helping of crâpes Suzette, the general explained: \"The hunting was not good last night. The fellow lost his head. He made a straight trail that offered no problems at all. That's the trouble with these sailors; they have dull brains to begin with, and they do not know how to get about in the woods. They do excessively stupid and obvious things. It's most annoying. Will you have another glass of Chablis, Mr. Rainsford?\"\n",
      "\"General,\" said Rainsford firmly, \"I wish to leave this island at once.\"\n",
      "The general raised his thickets of eyebrows; he seemed hurt. \"But, my dear fellow,\" the general protested, \"you've only just come. You've had no hunting--\"\n",
      "\"I wish to go today,\" said Rainsford. He saw the dead black eyes of the general on him, studying him. General Zaroff's face suddenly brightened.\n",
      "He filled Rainsford's glass with venerable Chablis from a dusty bottle.\n",
      "\"Tonight,\" said the general, \"we will hunt--you and I.\"\n",
      "Rainsford shook his head. \"No, general,\" he said. \"I will not hunt.\"\n",
      "The general shrugged his shoulders and delicately ate a hothouse grape. \"As you wish, my friend,\" he said. \"The choice rests entirely with you. But may I not venture to suggest that you will find my idea of sport more diverting than Ivan's?\"\n",
      "He nodded toward the corner to where the giant stood, scowling, his thick arms crossed on his hogshead of chest.\n",
      "\"You don't mean--\" cried Rainsford.\n",
      "\"My dear fellow,\" said the general, \"have I not told you I always mean what I say about hunting? This is really an inspiration. I drink to a foeman worthy of my steel--at last.\" The general raised his glass, but Rainsford sat staring at him.\n",
      "\"You'll find this game worth playing,\" the general said enthusiastically.\" Your brain against mine. Your woodcraft against mine. Your strength and stamina against mine. Outdoor chess! And the stake is not without value, eh?\"\n",
      "\"And if I win--\" began Rainsford huskily.\n",
      "\"I'll cheerfully acknowledge myself defeat if I do not find you by midnight of the third day,\" said General Zaroff. \"My sloop will place you on the mainland near a town.\" The general read what Rainsford was thinking.\n",
      "\"Oh, you can trust me,\" said the Cossack. \"I will give you my word as a gentleman and a sportsman. Of course you, in turn, must agree to say nothing of your visit here.\"\n",
      "\"I'll agree to nothing of the kind,\" said Rainsford.\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the general, \"in that case--But why discuss that now? Three days hence we can discuss it over a bottle of Veuve Cliquot, unless--\"\n",
      "The general sipped his wine.\n",
      "Then a businesslike air animated him. \"Ivan,\" he said to Rainsford, \"will supply you with hunting clothes, food, a knife. I suggest you wear moccasins; they leave a poorer trail. I suggest, too, that you avoid the big swamp in the southeast corner of the island. We call it Death Swamp. There's quicksand there. One foolish fellow tried it. The deplorable part of it was that Lazarus followed him. You can imagine my feelings, Mr. Rainsford. I loved Lazarus; he was the finest hound in my pack. Well, I must beg you to excuse me now. I always' take a siesta after lunch. You'll hardly have time for a nap, I fear. You'll want to start, no doubt. I shall not follow till dusk. Hunting at night is so much more exciting than by day, don't you think? Au revoir, Mr. Rainsford, au revoir.\" General Zaroff, with a deep, courtly bow, strolled from the room.\n",
      "From another door came Ivan. Under one arm he carried khaki hunting clothes, a haversack of food, a leather sheath containing a long-bladed hunting knife; his right hand rested on a cocked revolver thrust in the crimson sash about his waist.\n",
      "Rainsford had fought his way through the bush for two hours. \"I must keep my nerve. I must keep my nerve,\" he said through tight teeth.\n",
      "He had not been entirely clearheaded when the chateau gates snapped shut behind him. His whole idea at first was to put distance between himself and General Zaroff; and, to this end, he had plunged along, spurred on by the sharp rowers of something very like panic. Now he had got a grip on himself, had stopped, and was taking stock of himself and the situation. He saw that straight flight was futile; inevitably it would bring him face to face with the sea. He was in a picture with a frame of water, and his operations, clearly, must take place within that frame.\n",
      "\"I'll give him a trail to follow,\" muttered Rainsford, and he struck off from the rude path he had been following into the trackless wilderness. He executed a series of intricate loops; he doubled on his trail again and again, recalling all the lore of the fox hunt, and all the dodges of the fox. Night found him leg-weary, with hands and face lashed by the branches, on a thickly wooded ridge. He knew it would be insane to blunder on through the dark, even if he had the strength. His need for rest was imperative and he thought, \"I have played the fox, now I must play the cat of the fable.\" A big tree with a thick trunk and outspread branches was near by, and, taking care to leave not the slightest mark, he climbed up into the crotch, and, stretching out on one of the broad limbs, after a fashion, rested. Rest brought him new confidence and almost a feeling of security. Even so zealous a hunter as General Zaroff could not trace him there, he told himself; only the devil himself could follow that complicated trail through the jungle after dark. But perhaps the general was a devil--\n",
      "An apprehensive night crawled slowly by like a wounded snake and sleep did not visit Rainsford, although the silence of a dead world was on the jungle. Toward morning when a dingy gray was varnishing the sky, the cry of some startled bird focused Rainsford's attention in that direction. Something was coming through the bush, coming slowly, carefully, coming by the same winding way Rainsford had come. He flattened himself down on the limb and, through a screen of leaves almost as thick as tapestry, he watched. . . .  That which was approaching was a man.\n",
      "It was General Zaroff. He made his way along with his eyes fixed in utmost concentration on the ground before him. He paused, almost beneath the tree, dropped to his knees and studied the ground. Rainsford's impulse was to hurl himself down like a panther, but he saw that the general's right hand held something metallic--a small automatic pistol.\n",
      "The hunter shook his head several times, as if he were puzzled. Then he straightened up and took from his case one of his black cigarettes; its pungent incenselike smoke floated up to Rainsford's nostrils.\n",
      "Rainsford held his breath. The general's eyes had left the ground and were traveling inch by inch up the tree. Rainsford froze there, every muscle tensed for a spring. But the sharp eyes of the hunter stopped before they reached the limb where Rainsford lay; a smile spread over his brown face. Very deliberately he blew a smoke ring into the air; then he turned his back on the tree and walked carelessly away, back along the trail he had come. The swish of the underbrush against his hunting boots grew fainter and fainter.\n",
      "The pent-up air burst hotly from Rainsford's lungs. His first thought made him feel sick and numb. The general could follow a trail through the woods at night; he could follow an extremely difficult trail; he must have uncanny powers; only by the merest chance had the Cossack failed to see his quarry.\n",
      "Rainsford's second thought was even more terrible. It sent a shudder of cold horror through his whole being. Why had the general smiled? Why had he turned back?\n",
      "Rainsford did not want to believe what his reason told him was true, but the truth was as evident as the sun that had by now pushed through the morning mists. The general was playing with him! The general was saving him for another day's sport! The Cossack was the cat; he was the mouse. Then it was that Rainsford knew the full meaning of terror.\n",
      "\"I will not lose my nerve. I will not.\"\n",
      "He slid down from the tree, and struck off again into the woods. His face was set and he forced the machinery of his mind to function. Three hundred yards from his hiding place he stopped where a huge dead tree leaned precariously on a smaller, living one. Throwing off his sack of food, Rainsford took his knife from its sheath and began to work with all his energy.\n",
      "The job was finished at last, and he threw himself down behind a fallen log a hundred feet away. He did not have to wait long. The cat was coming again to play with the mouse.\n",
      "Following the trail with the sureness of a bloodhound came General Zaroff. Nothing escaped those searching black eyes, no crushed blade of grass, no bent twig, no mark, no matter how faint, in the moss. So intent was the Cossack on his stalking that he was upon the thing Rainsford had made before he saw it. His foot touched the protruding bough that was the trigger. Even as he touched it, the general sensed his danger and leaped back with the agility of an ape. But he was not quite quick enough; the dead tree, delicately adjusted to rest on the cut living one, crashed down and struck the general a glancing blow on the shoulder as it fell; but for his alertness, he must have been smashed beneath it. He staggered, but he did not fall; nor did he drop his revolver. He stood there, rubbing his injured shoulder, and Rainsford, with fear again gripping his heart, heard the general's mocking laugh ring through the jungle.\n",
      "\"Rainsford,\" called the general, \"if you are within sound of my voice, as I suppose you are, let me congratulate you. Not many men know how to make a Malay mancatcher. Luckily for me I, too, have hunted in Malacca. You are proving interesting, Mr. Rainsford. I am going now to have my wound dressed; it's only a slight one. But I shall be back. I shall be back.\"\n",
      "When the general, nursing his bruised shoulder, had gone, Rainsford took up his flight again. It was flight now, a desperate, hopeless\n",
      "\n",
      "flight, that carried him on for some hours. Dusk came, then darkness, and still he pressed on. The ground grew softer under his moccasins; the vegetation grew ranker, denser; insects bit him savagely.\n",
      "Then, as he stepped forward, his foot sank into the ooze. He tried to wrench it back, but the muck sucked viciously at his foot as if it were a giant leech. With a violent effort, he tore his feet loose. He knew where he was now. Death Swamp and its quicksand.\n",
      "His hands were tight closed as if his nerve were something tangible that someone in the darkness was trying to tear from his grip. The softness of the earth had given him an idea. He stepped back from the quicksand a dozen feet or so and, like some huge prehistoric beaver, he began to dig.\n",
      "Rainsford had dug himself in in France when a second's delay meant death. That had been a placid pastime compared to his digging now. The pit grew deeper; when it was above his shoulders, he climbed out and from some hard saplings cut stakes and sharpened them to a fine point. These stakes he planted in the bottom of the pit with the points sticking up. With flying fingers he wove a rough carpet of weeds and branches and with it he covered the mouth of the pit. Then, wet with sweat and aching with tiredness, he crouched behind the stump of a lightning-charred tree.\n",
      "He knew his pursuer was coming; he heard the padding sound of feet on the soft earth, and the night breeze brought him the perfume of the general's cigarette. It seemed to Rainsford that the general was coming with unusual swiftness; he was not feeling his way along, foot by foot. Rainsford, crouching there, could not see the general, nor could he see the pit. He lived a year in a minute. Then he felt an impulse to cry aloud with joy, for he heard the sharp crackle of the breaking branches as the cover of the pit gave way; he heard the sharp scream of pain as the pointed stakes found their mark. He leaped up from his place of concealment. Then he cowered back. Three feet from the pit a man was standing, with an electric torch in his hand.\n",
      "\"You've done well, Rainsford,\" the voice of the general called. \"Your Burmese tiger pit has claimed one of my best dogs. Again you score. I think, Mr. Rainsford, I'll see what you can do against my whole pack. I'm going home for a rest now. Thank you for a most amusing evening.\"\n",
      "At daybreak Rainsford, lying near the swamp, was awakened by a sound that made him know that he had new things to learn about fear. It was a distant sound, faint and wavering, but he knew it. It was the baying of a pack of hounds.\n",
      "Rainsford knew he could do one of two things. He could stay where he was and wait. That was suicide. He could flee. That was postponing the inevitable. For a moment he stood there, thinking. An idea that held a wild chance came to him, and, tightening his belt, he headed away from the swamp.\n",
      "The baying of the hounds drew nearer, then still nearer, nearer, ever nearer. On a ridge Rainsford climbed a tree. Down a watercourse, not a quarter of a mile away, he could see the bush moving. Straining his eyes, he saw the lean figure of General Zaroff; just ahead of him Rainsford made out another figure whose wide shoulders surged through the tall jungle weeds; it was the giant Ivan, and he seemed pulled forward by some unseen force; Rainsford knew that Ivan must be holding the pack in leash.\n",
      "They would be on him any minute now. His mind worked frantically. He thought of a native trick he had learned in Uganda. He slid down the tree. He caught hold of a springy young sapling and to it he fastened his hunting knife, with the blade pointing down the trail; with a bit of wild grapevine he tied back the sapling. Then he ran for his life. The hounds raised their voices as they hit the fresh scent. Rainsford knew now how an animal at bay feels.\n",
      "He had to stop to get his breath. The baying of the hounds stopped abruptly, and Rainsford's heart stopped too. They must have reached the knife.\n",
      "He shinned excitedly up a tree and looked back. His pursuers had stopped. But the hope that was in Rainsford's brain when he climbed died, for he saw in the shallow valley that General Zaroff was still on his feet. But Ivan was not. The knife, driven by the recoil of the springing tree, had not wholly failed.\n",
      "Rainsford had hardly tumbled to the ground when the pack took up the cry again.\n",
      "\"Nerve, nerve, nerve!\" he panted, as he dashed along. A blue gap showed between the trees dead ahead. Ever nearer drew the hounds. Rainsford forced himself on toward that gap. He reached it. It was the shore of the sea. Across a cove he could see the gloomy gray stone of the chateau. Twenty feet below him the sea rumbled and hissed. Rainsford hesitated. He heard the hounds. Then he leaped far out into the sea. . . .\n",
      "When the general and his pack reached the place by the sea, the Cossack stopped. For some minutes he stood regarding the blue-green expanse of water. He shrugged his shoulders. Then he sat down, took a drink of brandy from a silver flask, lit a cigarette, and hummed a bit from Madame Butterfly.\n",
      "General Zaroff had an exceedingly good dinner in his great paneled dining hall that evening. With it he had a bottle of Pol Roger and half a bottle of Chambertin. Two slight annoyances kept him from perfect enjoyment. One was the thought that it would be difficult to replace Ivan; the other was that his quarry had escaped him; of course, the American hadn't played the game--so thought the general as he tasted his after-dinner liqueur. In his library he read, to soothe himself, from the works of Marcus Aurelius. At ten he went up to his bedroom. He was deliciously tired, he said to himself, as he locked himself in. There was a little moonlight, so, before turning on his light, he went to the window and looked down at the courtyard. He could see the great hounds, and he called, \"Better luck another time,\" to them. Then he switched on the light.\n",
      "A man, who had been hiding in the curtains of the bed, was standing there.\n",
      "\"Rainsford!\" screamed the general. \"How in God's name did you get here?\"\n",
      "\"Swam,\" said Rainsford. \"I found it quicker than walking through the jungle.\"\n",
      "The general sucked in his breath and smiled. \"I congratulate you,\" he said. \"You have won the game.\"\n",
      "Rainsford did not smile. \"I am still a beast at bay,\" he said, in a low, hoarse voice. \"Get ready, General Zaroff.\"\n",
      "The general made one of his deepest bows. \"I see,\" he said. \"Splendid! One of us is to furnish a repast for the hounds. The other will sleep in this very excellent bed. On guard, Rainsford.\"\n",
      ". . .\n",
      "He had never slept in a better bed, Rainsford decided.\n",

      "Down below there was only a vast white undulating sea of cloud. Above there was the sun, and the sun was white like the clouds, because it is never yellow when one looks at it from high in the air.\n",
      "He was still flying the Spitfire. His right hand was on the stick, and he was working the rudder bar with his left leg alone. It was quite easy. The machine was flying well, and he knew what he was doing.\n",
      "Everything is fine, he thought. I'm doing all right. I'm doing nicely. I know my way home. I'll be there in half an hour. When I land I shall taxi in and switch off my engine and I shall say, help me to get out, will you. I shall make my voice sound ordinary and natural and none of them will take any notice. Then I shall say, someone help me to get out. I can't do it alone because I've lost one of my legs. They'll all laugh and think that I'm joking, and I shall say, all right, come and have a look, you unbelieving bastards. Then Yorky will climb up onto the wing and look inside. He'll probably be sick because of all the blood and the mess. I shall laugh and say, for God's sake, help me out.\n",
      "He glanced down again at his right leg. There was not much of it left. The cannon shell had taken him on the thigh, just above the knee, and now there was nothing but a great mess and a lot of blood. But there was no pain. When he looked down, he felt as though he were seeing something that did not belong to him. It had nothing to do with him. It was just a mess which happened to be there in the cockpit; something strange and unusual and rather interesting. It was like finding a dead cat on the sofa.\n",
      "He really felt fine, and because he still felt fine, he felt excited and unafraid.\n",
      "I won't even bother to call up on the radio for the blood wagon, he thought. It isn't necessary. And when I land I'll sit there quite normally and say, some of you fellows come and help me out, will you, because I've lost one of my legs. That will be funny. I'll laugh a little while I'm saying it; I'll say it calmly and slowly, and they'll think I'm joking. When Yorky comes up onto the wing and gets sick, I'll say, Yorky, you old son of a bitch, have you fixed my car yet? Then when I get out I'll make my report and later I'll go up to London. I'll take that half bottle of whisky with me and I'll give it to Bluey. We'll sit in her room and drink it. I'll get the water out of the bathroom tap. I won't say much until it's time to go to bed, then Ill say, Bluey, I've got a surprise for you. I lost a leg today. But I don't mind so long as you don't. It doesn't even hurt.\n",
      "We'll go everywhere in cars. I always hated walking, except when I walked down the street of the coppersmiths in Bagdad, but I could go in a rickshaw. I could go home and chop wood, but the head always flies off the ax. Hot water, that's what it needs; put it in the bath and make the handle swell. I chopped lots of wood last time I went home, and I put the ax in the bath. . . .\n",
      "Then he saw the sun shining on the engine cowling of his machine. He saw the rivets in the metal, and he remembered where he was. He realized that he was no longer feeling good; that he was sick and giddy. His head kept falling forward onto his chest because his neck seemed no longer to have any strength. But he knew that he was flying the Spitfire, and he could feel the handle of the stick between the fingers of his right hand.\n",
      "I'm going to pass out, he thought. Any moment now I'm going to pass out.\n",
      "He looked at his altimeter. Twenty-one thousand. To test himself \n",
      "\n",
      "he tried to read the hundreds as well as the thousands. Twenty-one thousand and what? As he looked the dial became blurred, and he could not even see the needle. He knew then that he must bail out; that there was not a second to lose, otherwise he would become unconscious. Quickly, frantically, he tried to slide back the hood with his left hand, but he had not the strength. For a second he took his right hand off the stick, and with both hands he managed to push the hood back. The rush of cold air on his face seemed to help. He had a moment of great clearness, and his actions became orderly and precise. That is what happens with a good pilot. He took some quick deep breaths from his oxygen mask, and as he did so, he looked out over the side of the cockpit. Down below there was only a vast white sea of cloud, and he realized that he did not know where he was.\n",
      "It'll be the Channel, he thought. I'm sure to fall in the drink.\n",
      "He throttled back, pulled off his helmet, undid his straps, and pushed the stick hard over to the left. The Spitfire dripped its port wing, and turned smoothly over onto its back. The pilot fell out.\n",
      "As he fell he opened his eyes, because he knew that he must not pass out before he had pulled the cord. On one side he saw the sun; on the other he saw the whiteness of the clouds, and as he fell, as he somersaulted in the air, the white clouds chased the sun and the sun chased the clouds. They chased each other in a small circle; they ran faster and faster, and there was the sun and the clouds and the clouds and the sun, and the clouds came nearer until suddenly there was no longer any sun, but only a great whiteness. The whole world was white, and there was nothing in it. It was so white that sometimes it looked black, and after a time it was either white or black, but mostly it was white. He watched it as it turned from white to black, and then back to white again, and the white stayed for a long time, but the black lasted only for a few seconds. He got into the habit of going to sleep during the white periods, and of waking up just in time to see the world when it was black. But the black was very quick. Sometimes it was only a flash, like someone switching off the light, and switching it on again at once, and so whenever it was white, he dozed off.\n",
      "One day, when it was white, he put out a hand and he touched something. He took it between his fingers and crumpled it. For a time he lay there, idly letting the tips of his fingers play with the thing which they had touched. Then slowly he opened his eyes, looked down at his hand, and saw that he was holding something which was white. It was the edge of a sheet. He knew it was a sheet because he could see the texture of the material and the stitchings on the hem. He screwed up his eyes, and opened them again quickly. This time he saw the room. He saw the bed in which he was lying; he saw the grey walls and the door and the green curtains over the window. There were some roses on the table by his bed.\n",
      "Then he saw the basin on the table near the roses. It was a white enamel basin, and beside it there was a small medicine glass.\n",
      "This is a hospital, he thought. I am in a hospital. But he could remember nothing. He lay back on his pillow, looking at the ceiling and wondering what had happened. He was gazing at the smooth greyness of the ceiling which was so clean and gray, and then suddenly he saw a fly walking upon it. The sight of this fly, the suddenness of seeing this small black speck on a sea of gray, brushed the surface of his brain, and quickly, in that second, he remembered everything. He remembered the Spitfire and he remembered the altimeter showing twenty-one thousand feet. He remembered the pushing back of the hood with both hands, and he remembered the bailing out. He remembered his leg.\n",
      "It seemed all right now. He looked down at the end of the bed, but he could not tell. He put one hand underneath the bedclothes and felt for his knees. He found one of them, but when he felt for the other, his hand touched something which was soft and covered in bandages.\n",
      "Just then the door opened and a nurse came in.\n",
      "\"Hello,\" she said. \"So you've waked up at last.\"\n",
      "She was not good-looking, but she was large and clean. She was between thirty and forty and she had fair hair. More than that he did not notice.\n",
      "\"Where am I?\"\n",
      "\"You're a lucky fellow. You landed in a wood near the beach. You're in \n",
      "\n",
      "Brighton. They brought you in two days ago, and now you're all fixed up. You look fine.\"\n",
      "\"I've lost a leg,\" he said.\n",
      "\"That's nothing. We'll get you another one. Now you must go to sleep. The doctor will be coming to see you in about an hour.\" She picked up the basin and the medicine glass and went out.\n",
      "But he did not sleep. He wanted to keep his eyes open because he was frightened that if he shut them again everything would go away. He lay looking at the ceiling. The fly was still there. It was very energetic. It would run forward very fast for a few inches, then it would stop. Then it would run forward again, stop, run forward, stop, and every now and then it would take off and buzz around viciously in small circles. It always landed back in the same place on the ceiling and started running and stopping all over again. He watched it for so long that after a while it was no longer a fly, but only a black speck upon a sea of gray, and he was still watching it when the nurse opened the door, and stood aside while the doctor came in. He was an Army \n",
      "doctor, a major, and he had some last war ribbons on his chest. He was bald and small, but he had a cheerful face and kind eyes.\n",
      "\"Well, well,\" he said. \"So you've decided to wake up at last. How are you feeling?\"\n",
      "\"I feel all right.\"\n",
      "\"That's the stuff. You'll be up and about in no time.\"\n",
      "The doctor took his wrist to feel his pulse.\n",
      "\"By the way,\" he said, \"some of the lads from your squadron were ringing up and asking about you. They wanted to come along and see you, but I said that they'd better wait a day or two. Told them you were all right, and that they could come and see you a little later on. Just lie quiet and take it easy for a bit. Got something to read?\" He glanced at the table with the roses. \"No. Well, nurse will look after you. She'll get you anything you want.\" With that he waved his hand and went out, followed by the large clean nurse.\n",
      "When they had gone, he lay back and looked at the ceiling again. The fly was still there and as he lay watching it he heard the noise of an airplane in the distance. He lay listening to the sound of its engines. It was a long way away. I wonder what it is, he thought. Let me see if I can place it. Suddenly he jerked his head sharply to one side. Anyone who has been bombed can tell the noise of a Junkers 88. They can tell most other German bombers for that matter, but especially a Junkers 88. The engines seem to sing a duet. There is a deep vibrating bass voice and with it there is a high pitched tenor. It is the singing of the tenor which makes the sound of a JU-88 something which one cannot mistake.\n",
      "He lay listening to the noise, and he felt quite certain about what it was. But where were the sirens, and where the guns? That German pilot certainly had a nerve coming near Brighton alone in daylight.\n",
      "The aircraft was always far away, and soon the noise faded away into the distance. Later on there was another. This one, too, was far away, but there was the same deep undulating bass and the high singing tenor, and there was no mistaking it. He had heard that noise every day during the battle.\n",
      "He was puzzled. There was a bell on the table by the bed. He reached out his hand and rang it. He heard the noise of footsteps down the corridor, and the nurse came in.\n",
      "\"Nurse, what were those airplanes?\"\n",
      "\"I'm sure I don't know. I didn't hear them. Probably fighters or bombers. I expect they were returning from France. Why, what's the matter?\"\n",
      "\"They were JU-88's. I'm sure they were JU-88's. I know the sound of the engines. There were two of them. What were they doing over here?\"\n",
      "The nurse came up to the side of his bed and began to straighten out the sheets and tuck them in under the mattress.\n",
      "\"Gracious me, what things you imagine. You mustn't worry about a thing like that. Would you like me to get you something to read?\"\n",
      "\"No, thank you.\"\n",
      "She patted his pillow and brushed back the hair from his forehead with her hand.\n",
      "\"They never come over in daylight any longer. You know that. They were probably Lancasters or Flying Fortresses.\" \n",
      "\"Nurse.\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"Could I have a cigarette?\"\n",
      "\"Why certainly you can.\"\n",
      "She went out and came back almost at once with a packet of Players and some matches. She handed one to him and when he had put it in his mouth, she struck a match and lit it.\n",
      "\"If you want me again,\" she said, \"just ring the bell,\" and she went out.\n",
      "Once toward evening he heard the noise of another aircraft. It was far away, but even so he knew that it was a single-engined machine. But he could not place it. It was going fast; he could tell that. But it wasn't a Spit, and it wasn't a Hurricane Fighter Air Craft. It did not sound like an American engine either. They make more noise. He did not know what it was, and it worried him greatly. Perhaps I am very ill, he thought. Perhaps I am imagining things. Perhaps I am a little delirious. I simply do not know what to think.\n",
      "That evening the nurse came in with a basin of hot water and began to wash him.\n",
      "\"Well,\" she said, \"I hope you don't still think that we're being bombed.\"\n",
      "She had taken off his pajama top and was soaping his right arm with a flannel. He did not answer.\n",
      "She rinsed the flannel in the water, rubbed more soap on it, and began to wash his chest.\n",
      "\"You're looking fine this evening,\" she said. \"They operated on you as soon as you came in. They did a marvelous job. You'll be all right. I've \n",
      "got a brother in the RAF,\" she added. \"Flying bombers.\"\n",
      "He said, \"I went to school in Brighton.\"\n",
      "She looked up quickly. \"Well, that's fine,\" she said. \"I expect you'll know some people in the town.\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said, \"I know quite a few.\"\n",
      "She had finished washing his chest and arms, and now she turned back the bedclothes, so that his left leg was uncovered. She did it in such a way that his bandaged stump remained under the sheets. She undid the cord of his pajama trousers and took them off. There was no trouble because they had cut off the right trouser leg, so that it could not interfere with the bandages. She began to wash his left leg and the rest of his body. This was the first time he had had a bed bath, and he was embarrassed. She laid a towel under his leg, and she was washing his foot with the flannel. She said, \"This wretched soap won't lather at all. It's the water. It's as hard as nails.\"\n",
      "He said, \"None of the soap is very good now and, of course, with hard water it's hopeless.\" As he said it he remembered something. He remembered the baths which he used to take at school in Brighton, in the long stone-floored bathroom which had four baths in a room. He remembered how the water was so soft that you had to take a shower afterwards to get all the soap off your body, and he remembered how the foam used to float on the surface of the water, so that you could not see your legs underneath. He remembered that sometimes they were given calcium tablets because the school doctor used to say that soft water was bad for the teeth.\n",
      "\"In Brighton,\" he said, \"the water isn't . . .\"\n",
      "He did not finish the sentence. Something had occurred to him; something so fantastic and absurd that for a moment he felt like telling the nurse about it and having a good laugh.\n",
      "She looked up. \"The water isn't what?\" she said. \n",
      "\"Nothing,\" he answered. \"I was dreaming.\n",
      "She rinsed the flannel in the basin, wiped the soap off his leg, and dried him with a towel.\n",
      "\"It's nice to be washed,\" he said. \"I feel better.\" He was feeling his face with his hands. \"I need a shave.\"\n",
      "\"We'll do that tomorrow,\" she said. \"Perhaps you can do it yourself then.\"\n",
      "That night he could not sleep. He lay awake thinking of the Junkers 88's and of the hardness of the water. He could think of nothing else. They were JU-88's, he said to himself. I know they were. And yet it is not possible, because they would not be flying around so low over here in broad daylight. I know that it is true, and yet I know that it is impossible. Perhaps I am ill. Perhaps I am behaving like a fool and do not know what I am doing or saying. Perhaps I am delirious. For a long time he lay awake thinking these things, and once he sat up in bed and said aloud, \"I will prove that I am not crazy. I will make a little speech about something complicated and intellectual. I will talk about what to do with Germany after the war.\" But before he had time to begin, he was asleep.\n",
      "He woke just as the first light of day was showing through the slit in the curtains over the window. The room was still dark, but he could tell that it was already beginning to get light outside. He lay looking at the grey light which was showing through the slit in the curtain, and as he lay there he remembered the day before. He remembered the Junkers 88's and the hardness of the water; he remembered the large pleasant nurse and the kind doctor, and now the small grain of doubt took root in his mind and it began to grow.\n",
      "He looked around the room. The nurse had taken the roses out the night before, and there was nothing except the table with a packet of cigarettes, a box of matches and an ash tray. Otherwise, it was bare. It was no longer warm or friendly. It was not even comfortable. It was cold and empty and very quiet.\n",
      "Slowly the grain of doubt grew, and with it came fear, a light, dancing fear that warned but did not frighten; the kind of fear that one gets not because one is afraid, but because one feels that there is something wrong. Quickly the doubt and the fear grew so that he became restless and angry, and when he touched his forehead with his hand, he found that it was damp with sweat. He knew then that he must do something; that he must find some way of proving to himself that he was either right or wrong, and he looked up and saw again the window and the green curtains. From where he lay, that window was right in front of him, but it was fully ten yards away. Somehow he must reach it and look out. The idea became an obsession with him, and soon he could think of nothing except the window. But what about his leg? He put his hand underneath the bedclothes and felt the thick bandaged stump which was all that was left on the right-hand side. It seemed all right. It didn't hurt. But it would not be easy.\n",
      "He sat up. Then he pushed the bedclothes aside and put his left leg on the floor. Slowly, carefully, he swung his body over until he had both hands on the floor as well; and then he was out of bed, kneeling on the carpet. He looked at the stump. It was very short and thick, covered with bandages. It was beginning to hurt and he could feel it throbbing. He wanted to collapse, lie down on the carpet and do nothing, but he knew that he must go on.\n",
      "With two arms and one leg, he crawled over towards the window. He would reach forward as far as he could with his arms, then he would give a little jump and slide his left leg along after them. Each time he did, it jarred his wound so that he gave a soft grunt of pain, but he continued to crawl across the floor on two hands and one knee. When he got to the window he reached up, and one at a time he placed both hands on the sill. Slowly he raised himself up until he was standing on his left leg. Then quickly he pushed aside the curtains and looked out.\n",
      "He saw a small house with a gray tiled roof standing alone beside a narrow lane, and immediately behind it there was a plowed field. In front of the house there was an untidy garden, and there was a green hedge separating the garden from the lane. He was looking at the hedge when he saw the sign. It was just a piece of board nailed to the top of a short pole, and because the hedge had not been trimmed for a long time, the branches had grown out around the sign so that it seemed almost as though it had been placed in the middle of the hedge. There was something written on the board with white paint, and he pressed his head against the glass of the window, trying to read what it said. The first letter was a G, he could see that. The second was an A, and the third was an R. One after another he managed to see what the letters were. There were three words, and slowly  he spelled the letters out aloud to himself as he managed to read them. G-A-R-D-E A-U C-H-I-E-N. Garde au chien. That is what it said.\n",
      "He stood there balancing on one leg and holding tightly to the edges of the window sill with his hands, staring at the sign and at the whitewashed lettering of the words. For a moment he could think of nothing at all. He stood there looking at the sign, repeating the words over and over to himself, and then slowly he began to realize the full meaning of the thing. He looked up at the cottage and at the plowed field. He looked at the small orchard on the left of the cottage and he looked at the green countryside beyond. \"So this is France,\" he said. \"I am France.\"\n",
      "Now the throbbing in his right thigh was very great. It felt as though someone was pounding the end of his stump with a hammer, and suddenly the pain became so intense that it affected his head and for a moment he thought he was going to fall. Quickly he knelt down again, crawled back to the bed and hoisted himself in. He pulled the bedclothes over himself and lay back on the pillow, exhausted. He could still think of nothing at all except the small sign by the hedge, and the plowed field and the orchard. It was the words on the sign that he could not forget.\n",
      "It was some time before the nurse came in. She came carrying a basin of hot water and she said, \"Good morning, how are you today?\"\n",
      "He said, \"Good morning, nurse.\"\n",
      "The pain was still great under the bandages, but he did not wish to tell this woman anything. He looked at her as she busied herself with getting the washing things ready. He looked at her more carefully now. Her hair was very fair. She was tall and big-boned, and her face seemed pleasant. But there was something a little uneasy about her eyes. They were never still. They never looked at anything for more than a moment and they moved too quickly from one place to another in the room. There was something about her movements also. They were too sharp and nervous to go well with the casual manner in which she spoke.\n",
      "She set down the basin, took off his pajama top and began to wash him.\n",
      "\"Did you sleep well?\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"Good,\" she said. She was washing his arms and his chest.\n",
      "\"I believe there's someone coming down to see you from the Air Ministry after breakfast,\" she went on. \"They want a report or something. I expect you know all about it. How you got shot down and all that. I won't let him stay long, so don't worry.\"\n",
      "He did not answer. She finished washing him, and gave him a toothbrush and some tooth powder. He brushed his teeth, rinsed his mouth and spat the water out into the basin.\n",
      "Later she brought him his breakfast on a tray, but he did not want to eat. He was still feeling weak and sick, and he wished only to lie still and think about what had happened. And there was a sentence running through his head. It was a sentence which Johnny, the Intelligence Officer of his squadron, always repeated to the pilots every day before they went out. He could see Johnny now, leaning against the wall of the dispersal hut with his pipe in his hand, saying, \"And if they get you, don't forget, just your name, rank and number. Nothing else. For God's sake, say nothing else.\"\n",
      "\"There you are,\" she said as she put the tray on his lap. \"I've got you an egg. Can you manage all right?\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "She stood beside the bed. \"Are you feeling all right?\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"Good. If you want another egg I might be able to get you one.\"\n",
      "\"This is all right.\"\n",
      "\"Well, just ring the bell if you want any more.\" And she went out.\n",
      "He had just finished eating, when the nurse came in again.\n",
      "She said, \"Wing Commander Roberts is here. I've told him that he can only stay for a few minutes.\"\n",
      "She beckoned with her hand and the Wing Commander came in.\n",
      "\"Sorry to bother you like this,\" he said.\n",
      "He was an ordinary RAF officer, dressed in a uniform which was a little shabby, and he wore wings and a DFC. He was fairly tall and thin with plenty of black hair. His teeth, which were irregular and widely spaced, stuck out a little even when he closed his mouth. As he spoke he took a printed form and a pencil from his pocket, and he pulled up a chair and sat down.\n",
      "\"How are you feeling?\"\n",
      "There was no answer.\n",
      "\"Tough luck about your leg. I know how you feel. I hear you put up a fine show before they got you.\"\n",
      "The man in the bed was lying quite still, watching the man in the chair.\n",
      "The man in the chair said, \"Well, let's get this stuff over. I'm afraid you'll have to answer a few questions so that I can fill in this combat report. Let me see now, first of all, what was your squadron?\"\n",
      "The man in the bed did not move. He looked straight at the Wing Commander and he said, \"My name is Peter Williamson. My rank is Squadron Leader and my number is nine seven two four five seven.\"\n",

      "\tNow and again she would glance up at the clock, but without anxiety, merely to please herself with the thought that each minute gone by made it nearer the time when he would come. There was a slow smiling air about her, and about everything she did. The drop of a head as she bent over her sewing was curiously tranquil. Her skin--for this was her sixth month with child--had acquired a wonderful translucent quality, the mouth was soft, and the eyes, with their new placid look, seemed larger darker than before. When the clock said ten minutes to five, she began to listen, and a few moments later, punctually as always, she heard the tires on the gravel outside, and the car door slamming, the footsteps passing the window, the key turning in the lock. She laid aside her sewing, stood up, and went forward to kiss him as he came in.\n",

Then she walked over and made the drinks, a strongish one for him, a weak one for herself; and soon she was back again in her chair with the sewing, and he in the other, opposite, holding the tall glass with both hands, rocking it so the ice cubes tinkled against the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\tFor her, this was always a blissful time of day. She knew he didn't want to speak much until the first drink was finished, and she, on her side, was content to sit quietly, enjoying his company after the long hours alone in the house. She loved to luxuriate in the presence of this man, and to feel-almost as a sunbather feels the sun-that warm male glow that came out of him to her when they were alone together. She loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair, for the way he came in a door, or moved slowly across the room with long strides. She loved intent, far look in his eyes when they rested in her, the funny shape of the mouth, and especially the way he remained silent about his tiredness, sitting still with himself until the whiskey had taken some of it away.\n",

She wasn't really watching him, but she knew what he had done because she heard the ice cubes falling back against the bottom of the empty glass when he lowered his arm. He paused a moment, leaning forward in the chair, then he got up and went slowly over to fetch himself another.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"This is going to be a bit of a shock to you, I'm afraid,\" he said. \"But I've thought about it a good deal and I've decided the only thing to do is tell you right away. I hope you won't blame me too much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he told her. It didn't take long, four or five minutes at most, and she say very still through it all, watching him with a kind of dazed horror as he went further and further away from her with each word.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So there it is,\" he added. \"And I know it's kind of a bad time to be telling you, bet there simply wasn't any other way. Of course I'll give you money and see you're looked after. But there needn't really be any fuss. I hope not anyway. It wouldn't be very good for my job.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first instinct was not to believe any of it, to reject it all. It occurred to her that perhaps he hadn't even spoken, that she herself had imagined the whole thing. Maybe, if she went about her business and acted as though she hadn't been listening, then later, when she sort of woke up again, she might find none of it had ever happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get the supper,\" she managed to whisper, and this time he didn't stop her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she walked across the room she couldn't feel her feet touching the floor. She couldn't feel anything at all- except a slight nausea and a desire to vomit. Everything was automatic now-down the steps to the cellar, the light switch, the deep freeze, the hand inside the cabinet taking hold of the first object it met. She lifted it out, and looked at it. It was wrapped in paper, so she took off the paper and looked at it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "A leg of lamb.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right then, they would have lamb for supper. She carried it upstairs, holding the thin bone-end of it with both her hands, and as she went through the living-room, she saw him standing over by the window with his back to her, and she stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For God's sake,\" he said, hearing her, but not turning round. \"Don't make supper for me. I'm going out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, Mary Maloney simply walked up behind him and without any pause she swung the big frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brought it down as hard as she could on the back of his head.\n",

      "She might just as well have hit him with a steel club.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stepped back a pace, waiting, and the funny thing was that he remained standing there for at least four or five seconds, gently swaying. Then he crashed to the carpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The violence of the crash, the noise, the small table overturning, helped bring her out of he shock. She came out slowly, feeling cold and surprised, and she stood for a while blinking at the body, still holding the ridiculous piece of meat tight with both hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right, she told herself. So I've killed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was extraordinary, now, how clear her mind became all of a sudden. She began thinking very fast. As the wife of a detective, she knew quite well what the penalty would be. That was fine. It made no difference to her. In fact, it would be a relief. On the other hand, what about the child? What were the laws about murderers with unborn children? Did they kill then both-mother and child? Or did they wait until the tenth month? What did they do?\n",

      "\n",
      "She carried the meat into the kitchen, placed it in a pan, turned the oven on high, and shoved t inside. Then she washed her hands and ran upstairs to the bedroom. She sat down before the mirror, tidied her hair, touched up her lops and face. She tried a smile. It came out rather peculiar. She tried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hullo Sam,\" she said brightly, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice sounded peculiar too.\n",

      "\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was better. Both the smile and the voice were coming out better now. She rehearsed it several times more. Then she ran downstairs, took her coat, went out the back door, down the garden, into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't six o'clock yet and the lights were still on in the grocery shop.\n",
      "\n",

      "The man turned and reached up behind him on the shelf for the peas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Patrick's decided he's tired and doesn't want to eat out tonight,\" she told him. \"We usually go out Thursdays, you know, and now he's caught me without any vegetables in the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then how about meat, Mrs. Maloney?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I've got meat, thanks. I got a nice leg of lamb from the freezer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh.\"\n",

      "\"I don't know much like cooking it frozen, Sam, but I'm taking a chance on it this time. You think it'll be all right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Personally,\" the grocer said, \"I don't believe it makes any difference. You want these Idaho potatoes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes, that'll be fine. Two of those.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anything else?\" The grocer cocked his head on one side, looking at her pleasantly. \"How about afterwards? What you going to give him for afterwards?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well-what would you suggest, Sam?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man glanced around his shop. \"How about a nice big slice of cheesecake? I know he likes that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perfect,\" she said. \"He loves it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And when it was all wrapped and she had paid, she put on her brightest smile and said, \"Thank you, Sam. Goodnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodnight, Mrs. Maloney. And thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, she told herself as she hurried back, all she was doing now, she was returning home to her husband and he was waiting for his supper; and she must cook it good, and make it as tasty as possible because the poor man was tired; and if, when she entered the house, she happened to find anything unusual, or tragic, or terrible, then naturally it would be a shock and she'd become frantic with grief and horror. Mind you, she wasn't expecting to find anything. She was just going home with the vegetables. \n",
      "Mrs. Patrick Maloney going home with the vegetables on Thursday evening to cook supper for her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the way, she told herself. Do everything right and natural. Keep things absolutely natural and there'll be no need for any acting at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, when she entered the kitchen by the back door, she was humming a little tune to herself and smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Patrick!\" she called. \"How are you, darling?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She put the parcel down on the table and went through into the living room; and when she saw him lying there on the floor with his legs doubled up and one arm twisted back underneath his body, it really was rather a shock. All the old love and longing for him welled up inside her, and she ran over to him, knelt down beside him, and began to cry her heart out. It was easy. No acting was necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes later she got up and went to the phone. She know the number of the police station, and when the man at the other end answered, she cried to him, \"Quick! Come quick! Patrick's dead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's speaking?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Patrick Maloney.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean Patrick Maloney's dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think so,\" she sobbed. \"He's lying on the floor and I think he's dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be right over,\" the man said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The car came very quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policeman walked in. She know them both-she know nearly all the man at that precinct-and she fell right into a chair, then went over to join the other one, who was called O'Malley, kneeling by the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he dead?\" she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid he is. What happened?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Briefly, she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to find him on the floor. While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, other men began to come into the house. First a doctor, then two detectives, one of whom she know by name. Later, a police photographer arrived and took pictures, and a man who know about fingerprints. There was a great deal of whispering and muttering beside the corpse, and the detectives kept asking her a lot of questions. But they always treated her kindly. She told her story again, this time right from the beginning, when Patrick had come in, and she was sewing, and he was tired, so tired he hadn't wanted to go out for supper. She told how she'd put the meat in the oven-\"it's there now, cooking\"- and how she'd slopped out to the grocer for vegetables, and come back to find him lying on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which grocer?\" one of the detectives asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told him, and he turned and whispered something to the other detective who immediately went outside into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fifteen minutes he was back with a page of notes, and there was more whispering, and through her sobbing she heard a few of the whispered phrases-\"...acted quite normal...very cheerful...wanted to give him a good supper...peas...cheesecake...impossible that she...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, the photographer and the doctor departed and two other men came in and took the corpse away on a stretcher. Then the fingerprint man went away. The two detectives remained, and so did the two policeman. They were exceptionally nice to her, and Jack Noonan asked if she wouldn't rather go somewhere else, to her sister's house perhaps, or to his own wife who would take care of her and put her up for the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, she said. She didn't feel she could move even a yard at the moment. Would they mind awfully of she stayed just where she was until she felt better. She didn't feel too good at the moment, she really didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then hadn't she better lie down on the bed? Jack Noonan asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, she said. She'd like to stay right where she was, in this chair. A little later, perhaps, when she felt better, she would move.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they left her there while they went about their business, searching the house. Occasionally on of the detectives asked her another question. Sometimes Jack Noonan spoke at her gently as he passed by. Her husband, he told her, had been killed by a blow on the back of the head administered with a heavy blunt instrument, almost certainly a large piece of metal. They were looking for the weapon. The murderer may have taken it with him, but on the other hand he may have thrown it away or hidden it somewhere on the premises.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the old story,\" he said. \"Get the weapon, and you've got the man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing-a very big spanner, for example, or a heavy metal vase.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or a big spanner?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like that in the garage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and sometimes she saw a flash of a torch through a chink in the curtains. It began to get late, nearly nine she noticed by the clock on the mantle. The four men searching the rooms seemed to be growing weary, a trifle exasperated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jack,\" she said, the next tome Sergeant Noonan went by. \"Would you mind giving me a drink?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure I'll give you a drink. You mean this whiskey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes please. But just a small one. It might make me feel better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He handed her the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you have one yourself,\" she said. \"You must be awfully tired. Please do. You've been very good to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he answered. \"It's not strictly allowed, but I might take just a drop to keep me going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one the others came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whiskey. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands, uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant Noonan wandered into the kitchen, come out quickly and said, \"Look, Mrs. Maloney. You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh dear me!\" she cried. \"So it is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you do that, Jack. Thank you so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sergeant returned the second time, she looked at him with her large, dark tearful eyes. \"Jack Noonan,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you do me a small favor-you and these others?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can try, Mrs. Maloney.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" she said. \"Here you all are, and good friends of dear Patrick's too, and helping to catch the man who killed him. You must be terrible hungry by now because it's long past your suppertime, and I know Patrick would never forgive me, God bless his soul, if I allowed you to remain in his house without offering you decent hospitality. Why don't you eat up that lamb that's in the oven. It'll be cooked just right by now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't dream of it,\" Sergeant Noonan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please,\" she begged. \"Please eat it. Personally I couldn't tough a thing, certainly not what's been in the house when he was here. But it's all right for you. It'd be a favor to me if you'd eat it up. Then you can go on with your work again afterwards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a good deal of hesitating among the four policemen, but they were clearly hungry, and in the end they were persuaded to go into the kitchen and help themselves. The woman stayed where she was, listening to them speaking among themselves, their voices thick and sloppy because their mouths were full of meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have some more, Charlie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Better not finish it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She wants us to finish it. She said so. Be doing her a favor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Okay then. Give me some more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the hell of a big club the gut must've used to hit poor Patrick,\" one of them was saying. \"The doc says his skull was smashed all to pieces just like from a sledgehammer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's why it ought to be easy to find.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly what I say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whoever done it, they're not going to be carrying a thing like that around with them longer than they need.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of them belched.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Personally, I think it's right here on the premises.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably right under our very noses. What you think, Jack?\"\n",

      "It was a fine garden with lawns and beds of azaleas and tall coconut palms, and the wind was blowing strongly through the tops of\n",

      "There were plenty of deck chairs around the swimming pool and there were white tables and huge brightly colored umbrellas and\n",

      "\"Certainly,\" I said. \"Go ahead.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A fine evening,\" he said. \"They are all evenings fine here in Jamaica.\" I couldn't tell if the accent were Italian or Spanish,\n",
      "but I felt fairly sure he was some sort of a South American. And old too, when you saw him close. Probably around sixty-eight or\n",
      "seventy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I said. \"It is wonderful here, isn't it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who, might I ask are all dese? Dese is no hotel people.\" He was pointing at the bathers in the pool.\n",

      "\"Tank you, no, but I tink I have a cigar.\" He pulled out a crocodile case and got himself a cigar, then he produced a knife which\n",
      "had a small scissors in it and he snipped the end off the cigar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, let me give you a light.\" The American boy held up his lighter.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sure,\" the boy said. \"That's right.\" He was about nineteen or twenty with a long freckled face and a rather sharp birdlike\n",
      "nose. His chest was not very sunburned and there were freckles there too, and a few wisps of pale-reddish hair. He was holding\n",
      "the lighter in his right hand, ready to flip the wheel. \"It never fails,\" he said, smiling now because he was purposely\n",
      "exaggerating his little boast. \"I promise you it never fails.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One momint, pleess.\" The hand that held the cigar came up high, palm outward, as though it were stopping traffic. \"Now juss one\n",
      "momint.\" He had a curiously soft, toneless voice and he kept looking at the boy all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we not perhaps make a little bet on dat?\" He smiled at the boy. \"Shall we not make a little bet on whether your lighter\n",
      "lights?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure, I'll bet,\" the boy said. \"Why not?\"\n",

      "\"Sure, I'll always bet.\"\n",

      "to make something out of this, and to embarrass the boy, and at the same time I had the feeling he was relishing a private little\n",
      "secret all his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked up again at the boy and said slowly, \"I like to bet, too. Why we don't have a good bet on dis ting? A good big bet?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now wait a minute,\" the boy said. \"I can't do that. But I'll bet you a dollar, or whatever it is over here-some shillings, I\n",

      "\n",
      "The little man waved his hand again. \"Listen to me. Now we have some fun. We make a bet. Den we go up to my room here in de\n",

      "\"Sure, I'd like to have a Cadillac.\" The boy was still grinning.\n",

      "\n",
      "The boy sat quite still, staring at the bathers in the pool. Then he remembered suddenly he hadn't lighted his cigarette. He put\n",

      "was sitting there very still, and it was obvious that a small tension was beginning to build up inside him. Then he started\n",
      "shifting about in his seat, and rubbing his chest, and stroking the back of his neck, and finally he placed both hands on his knees\n",
      "and began tapping his fingers against his knee-caps. Soon he was tapping with one of his feet as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"First,\" he said, \"we'ave a little Martini.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The drinks were on a small table in the far corner, all ready to be mixed, and there was a shaker and ice and plenty of glasses. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" he said, putting down the bottle of gin, taking a wallet from his pocket and pulling out a pound note. \"You will do\n",
      "something for me now, pleess.\" He gave the maid the pound.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You keep dat,\" he said. \"And now we are going to play a little game in here and I want you to go off and find for me two-no\n",

      "\"A chopping knife!\" The maid opened her eyes wide and clasped her hands in front of her. \"You mean a real chopping knife?\"\n",

      "blue bathing suit, who watched the boy over the top of her glass all the time; the little man with the colorless eyes standing\n",
      "there in his immaculate white suit drinking his Martini and looking at the girl in her pale blue bathing dress. I didn't know what\n",
      "to make of it all. The man seemed serious about the bet and he seemed serious about the business of cutting off the finger. But\n",
      "hell, what if the boy lost? Then we'd have to rush him to the hospital in the Cadillac that he hadn't won. That would be a fine\n",

      "\"Before we begin,\" he said, \"I will present to de-to de referee de key of de car.\" He produced a car key from his pocket and gave\n",
      "it to me. \"De papers,\" he said, \"de owning papers and insurance are in de pocket of de car.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the colored maid came in again. In one hand she carried a small chopper, the kind used by butchers for chopping meat bones,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Good! You get dem all. Tank you, tank you. Now you can go.\" He waited until the maid had closed the door, then he put the\n",
      "implements on one of the beds and said, \"Now we prepare ourselves, yes?\" And to the boy \"Help me, pleess, with dis table. We\n",
      "carry it out a little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the usual kind of hotel writing desk, just a plain rectangular table about four feet by three with a blotting pad, ink,\n",
      "pens and paper. They carried it out into the room away from the wall, and removed the writing things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now,\" he said, \"a chair.\" He picked up a chair and placed it beside the table. He was very brisk and very animated, like a\n",
      "person organizing games at a children's party. \"And now de nails. I must put in de nails.\" He fetched the nails and he began to\n",
      "hammer them into the top of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stood there, the boy, the girl, and I, holding Martinis in out hands, watching the little man at work. We watched him hammer\n",
      "two nails into the table, about six inches apart. He didn't hammer them right home; he allowed a small part of each one to stick\n",
      "up. Then he tested them for firmness with his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone would think the son of a bitch had done this before, I told myself. He never hesitates. Table, nails, hammer, kitchen\n",
      "chopper. He knows exactly what he needs and how to arrange it.\n",

      "\"And now,\" he said, \"all we want is some string.\" He found some string. \"All right, at last we are ready. Will you pleess to\n",

      "your hand secure to de table-so,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He wound the string around the boy's wrist, then several times around the wide part of the hand, then he fastened it tight to the\n",
      "nails. He made a good job of it and when he'd finished there wasn't any question about the boy being able to draw his hand away. \n",
      "But he could move his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now pleess, clench de fist, all except for de little finger. You must leave de little finger sticking out, lying on de table.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "He skipped over to the bed and picked up the chopper. He came back and stood beside the table with the chopper in his hand.\n",

      "\n",
      "The English girl was standing there in her pale blue bathing costume right behind the boy's chair. She was just standing there,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Quite ready,\" he said and he lifted the chopper up in the air and held it there about two feet above the boy's finger, ready to\n",
      "chop. The boy watched it, but he didn't flinch and his mouth didn't move at all. He merely raised his eyebrows and frowned.\n",

      "With his thumb he raised the top of the lighter, and again with the thumb he gave the wheel a sharp flick. The flint sparked and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"One!\" I called.\n",

      "\"Seven!\" Obviously it was one of those lighters that worked. The fling gave a big spark and the wick was the right length. I\n",
      "watched the thumb snapping the top down onto the flame. Then a pause. Then the thumb raising the top once more. This was an\n",
      "all-thumb operation. The thumb did everything. I took a breath, ready to say eight. The thumb flicked the wheel. The flint\n",
      "sparked. The little flame appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eight!\" I said, and as I said it the door opened. We all turned and we saw a woman standing in the doorway, a small,\n",
      "black-haired woman, rather old, who stood there for about two seconds then rushed forward shouting, \"Carlos! Carlos!\" She grabbed\n",
      "his wrist, took the chopper from him, threw it on the bed, took hold of the little man by the lapels of his white suit and began\n",
      "shaking him very vigorously, talking to him fast and loud and fiercely all the time in some Spanish-sounding language. She shook\n",
      "him so fast you couldn't see him any more. He became a faint, misty, quickly moving outline, like the spokes of a turning wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she slowed down and the little man came into view again and she hauled him across the room and pushed him backward onto one\n",
      "of the beds. He sat on the edge of it blinking his eyes and testing his head to see if it would still turn on his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so sorry,\" the woman said. \"I am so terribly sorry that this should happen.\" She spoke almost perfect English.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is too bad,\" she went on. \"I suppose it is really my fault. For ten minutes I leave him alone to go and have my hair washed\n",
      "and I come back and he is at it again.\" She looked sorry and deeply concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was untying his hand from the table. The English girl and I stood there and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a menace,\" the woman said. \"Down where we live at home he has taken altogether forty-seven fingers from different people,\n",
      "and he has lost eleven cars. In the end they threatened to have him put away somewhere. That's why I brought him up here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were only having a little bet,\" mumbled the little man from the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose he bet you a car,\" the woman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" the boy answered. \"A Cadillac.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has no car. It's mine. And that makes it worse,\" she said, \"that he should bet you when he has nothing to bet with. I am\n",
      "ashamed and very sorry about it all.\" She seemed an awfully nice woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" I said, \"then here's the key of your car.\" I put it on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were only having a little bet,\" mumbled the little man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He hasn't anything left to bet with,\" the woman said. \"He hasn't a thing in the world. Not a thing. As a matter of fact I\n",
      "myself won it all from him a long while ago. It took time, a lot of time, and it was hard work, but I won it all in the end.\" She\n",
      "looked up at the boy and she smiled, a slow sad smile, and she came over and put out a hand to take the key from the table.\n",

      "For over forty years, in one part of the world or another, old man Marshall had, served his country as a United States consul. He had been appointed by Lincoln. For a quarter of a century that fact was his distinction. It was now his epitaph. But in former years, as each new administration succeeded the old, it had again and again saved his official head. When victorious and voracious place-hunters, searching the map of the world for spoils, dug out his hiding-place and demanded his consular sign as a reward for a younger and more aggressive party worker, the ghost of the dead President protected him. In the State Department, Marshall had become a tradition. \"You can't touch Him!\" the State Department would say; \"why, HE was appointed by Lincoln!\" Secretly, for this weapon against the hungry headhunters, the department was infinitely grateful. Old man Marshall was a consul after its own heart. Like a soldier, he was obedient, disciplined; wherever he was sent, there, without question, he would go. Never against exile, against ill-health, against climate did he make complaint. Nor when he was moved on and down to make way for some ne'er-do-well with influence, with a brother-in- law in the Senate, with a cousin owning a newspaper, with rich relatives who desired him to drink himself to death at the expense of the government rather than at their own, did old man Marshall point to his record as a claim for more just treatment.\n",
      "And it had been an excellent record. His official reports, in a quaint, stately hand, were models of English; full of information, intelligent, valuable, well observed. And those few of his countrymen, who stumbled upon him in the out-of-the-world places to which of late he had been banished, wrote of him to the department in terms of admiration and awe. Never had he or his friends petitioned for promotion, until it was at last apparent that, save for his record and the memory of his dead patron, he had no friends. But, still in the department the tradition held and, though he was not advanced, he was not dismissed.\n",
      "\"If that old man's been feeding from the public trough ever since the Civil War,\" protested a \"practical\" politician, \"it seems to me, Mr. Secretary, that he's about had his share. Ain't it time he give some one else a bite? Some of us that has, done the work, that has borne the brunt--\"\n",
      "\"This place he now holds,\" interrupted the Secretary of State suavely, \"is one hardly commensurate with services like yours. I can't pronounce the name of it, and I'm not sure just where it is, but I see that, of the last six consuls we sent there, three resigned within a month and the other three died of yellow-fever. Still, if you. insist--\"\n",
      "The practical politician reconsidered hastily. \"I'm not the sort,\" he protested, \"to turn out a man appointed by our martyred President. Besides, he's so old now, if the fever don't catch him, he'll die of old age, anyway.\"\n",
      "The Secretary coughed uncomfortably. \"And they say,\" he murmured, \"republics are ungrateful.\"\n",
      "\"I don't quite get that,\" said the practical politician.\n",
      "Of Porto Banos, of the Republic of Colombia, where as consul Mr. Marshall was upholding the dignity of the United States, little could be said except that it possessed a sure harbor. When driven from the Caribbean Sea by stress of weather, the largest of ocean tramps, and even battle-ships, could find in its protecting arms of coral a safe shelter. But, as young Mr. Aiken, the wireless operator, pointed out, unless driven by a hurricane and the fear of death, no one ever visited it. Back of the ancient wharfs, that dated from the days when Porto Banos was a receiver of stolen goods for buccaneers and pirates, were rows of thatched huts, streets, according to the season, of dust or mud, a few iron-barred, jail-like barracks, customhouses, municipal buildings, and the whitewashed adobe houses of the consuls. The backyard of the town was a swamp. Through this at five each morning a rusty engine pulled a train of flat cars to the base of the mountains, and, if meanwhile the rails had not disappeared into the swamp, at five in the evening brought back the flat cars laden with odorous coffeesacks.\n",
      "In the daily life of Porto Banos, waiting for the return of the train, and betting if it would return, was the chief interest. Each night the consuls, the foreign residents, the wireless operator, the manager of the rusty railroad met for dinner. There at the head of the long table, by virtue of his years, of his courtesy and distinguished manner, of his office, Mr. Marshall presided. Of the little band of exiles he was the chosen ruler. His rule was gentle. By force of example he had made existence in Porto Banos more possible. For women and children Porto Banos was a death-trap, and before \"old man Marshall\" came there had been no influence to remind the enforced bachelors of other days.\n",
      "They had lost interest, had grown lax, irritable, morose. Their white duck was seldom white. Their cheeks were unshaven. When the sun sank into the swamp and the heat still turned Porto Banos into a Turkish bath, they threw dice on the greasy tables of the CafÃ© Bolivar for drinks. The petty gambling led to petty quarrels; the drinks to fever. The coming of Mr. Marshall changed that. His standard of life, his tact, his worldly wisdom, his cheerful courtesy, his fastidious personal neatness shamed the younger men; the desire to please him, to, stand well in his good opinion, brought back pride and self-esteem.\n",
      "The lieutenant of her Majesty's gun-boat PLOVER noted the change.\n",
      "\"Used to be,\" he exclaimed, \"you couldn't get out of the CafÃ© Bolivar without some one sticking a knife in you; now it's a debating club. They all sit round a table and listen to an old gentleman talk world politics.\"\n",
      "If Henry Marshall brought content to the exiles of Porto Banos, there was little in return that Porto Banos could give to him. Magazines and correspondents in six languages kept him in touch with those foreign lands in which he had represented his country, but of the country he had represented, newspapers and periodicals showed him only too clearly that in forty years it had grown away from him, had changed beyond recognition.\n",
      "When last he had called at the State Department, he had been made to feel he was a man without a country, and when he visited his home town in Vermont, he was looked upon as a Rip Van Winkle. Those of his boyhood friends who were not dead had long thought of him as dead. And the sleepy, pretty village had become a bustling commercial centre. In the lanes where, as a young man, he had walked among wheatfields, trolley-cars whirled between rows of mills and factories. The children had grown to manhood, with children of their own.\n",
      "Like a ghost, he searched for house after house, where once he had been made welcome, only to find in its place a towering office building. \"All had gone, the old familiar faces.\" In vain he scanned even the shop fronts for a friendly, homelike name. Whether the fault was his, whether he would better have served his own interests than those of his government, it now was too late to determine. In his own home, he was a stranger among strangers. In the service he had so faithfully followed, rank by rank, he had been dropped, until now he, who twice had been a consul-general, was an exile, banished to a fever swamp. The great Ship of State had dropped him overside, had \"marooned\" him, and sailed away.\n",
      "Twice a day he walked along the shell road to the CafÃ© Bolivar, and back again to the consulate. There, as he entered the outer office, JosÃ© the Colombian clerk, would rise and bow profoundly.\n",
      "\"Any papers for me to sign, JosÃ©? \" the consul would ask.\n",
      "\"Not to-day, Excellency, \"the clerk would reply. Then JosÃ© would return to writing a letter to his lady-love; not that there was any-thing to tell her, but because writing on the official paper of the consulate gave him importance in his eyes, and in hers. And in the inner office the consul would continue to gaze at the empty harbor, the empty coral reefs, the empty, burning sky.\n",
      "The little band of exiles were at second break fast when the wireless man came in late to announce that a Red D. boat and the island of Curacao had both reported a hurricane coming north. Also, that much concern was felt for the safety of the yacht SERAPIS. Three days before, in advance of her coming, she had sent a wireless to Wilhelmstad, asking the captain of the port to reserve a berth for her. She expected to arrive the following morning. But for forty-eight hours nothing had been heard from her, and it was believed she had been overhauled by the hurricane. Owing to the presence on board of Senator Hanley, the closest friend of the new President, the man who had made him president, much concern was felt at Washington. To try to pick her up by wireless, the gun-boat NEWARK had been ordered from Culebra, the cruiser RALEIGH, with Admiral Hardy on board, from Colon. It was possible she would seek shelter at Porto Banos. The consul was ordered to report.\n",
      "As Marshall wrote out his answer, the French consul exclaimed with interest:\n",
      "\"He is of importance, then, this senator?\" he asked. \"Is it that in your country ships of war are at the service of a senator?\"\n",
      "Aiken, the wireless operator, grinned derisively.\n",
      "\"At the service of THIS senator, they are!\" he answered. \"They call him the 'king-maker,' the man behind the throne.\"\n",
      "\"But in your country,\" protested the Frenchman, \"there is no throne. I thought your president was elected by the people?\"\n",
      "\"That's what the people think,\" answered Aiken. \"In God's country,\" he explained, \"the trusts want a rich man in the Senate, with the same interests as their own, to represent them. They chose Hanley. He picked out of the candidates for the presidency the man he thought would help the interests. He nominated him, and the people voted for him. Hanley is what we call a 'boss.'\"\n",
      "The Frenchman looked inquiringly at Marshall.\n",
      "\"The position of the boss is the more dangerous,\" said Marshall gravely, \"because it is unofficial, because there are no laws to curtail his powers. Men like Senator Hanley are a menace to good government. They see in public office only a reward for party workers.\"\n",
      "\"That's right,\" assented Aiken. \"Your forty years' service, Mr. Consul, wouldn't count with Hanley. If he wanted your job, he'd throw you out as quick as he would a drunken cook.\"\n",
      "Mr. Marshall flushed painfully, and the French consul hastened to interrupt.\n",
      "\"Then, let us pray,\" he exclaimed, with fervor, \"that the hurricane has sunk the SERAPIS, and all on board.\"\n",
      "Two hours later, the SERAPIS, showing she had met the hurricane and had come out second best, steamed into the harbor.\n",
      "Her owner was young Herbert Livingstone, of Washington. He once had been in the diplomatic service, and, as minister to The Hague, wished to return to it. In order to bring this about he had subscribed liberally to the party campaign fund.\n",
      "With him, among other distinguished persons, was the all-powerful Hanley. The kidnapping of Hanley for the cruise, in itself, demonstrated the ability of Livingstone as a diplomat. It was the opinion of many that it would surely lead to his appointment as a minister plenipotentiary. Livingstone was of the same opinion. He had not lived long in the nation's capital without observing the value of propinquity. How many men he knew were now paymasters, and secretaries of legation, solely because those high in the government met them daily at the Metropolitan Club, and preferred them in almost any other place. And if, after three weeks as his guest on board what the newspapers called his floating palace, the senator could refuse him even the prize, legation of Europe, there was no value in modest merit. As yet, Livingstone had not hinted at his ambition. There was no need. To a statesman of Hanley's astuteness, the largeness of Livingstone's contribution to the campaign fund was self-explanatory.\n",
      "After her wrestling-match with the hurricane, all those on board the SERAPIS seemed to find in land, even in the swamp land of Porto Banos, a compelling attraction. Before the anchors hit the water, they were in the launch. On reaching shore, they made at once for the consulate. There were many cables they wished to start on their way by wireless; cables to friends, to newspapers, to the government.\n",
      "JosÃ©, the Colombian clerk, appalled by the unprecedented invasion of visitors, of visitors so distinguished, and Marshall, grateful for a chance to serve his fellow-countrymen, and especially his countrywomen, were ubiquitous, eager, indispensable. At JosÃ©'s desk the great senator, rolling his cigar between his teeth, was using, to JosÃ©'s ecstasy, JosÃ©'s own pen to write a reassuring message to the White House. At the consul's desk a beautiful creature, all in lace and pearls, was struggling to compress the very low opinion she held of a hurricane into ten words. On his knee, Henry Cairns, the banker, was inditing instructions to his Wall Street office, and upon himself Livingstone had taken the responsibility of replying to the inquiries heaped upon Marshall's desk, from many newspapers.\n",
      "It was just before sunset, and Marshall produced his tea things, and the young person in pearls and lace, who was Miss Cairns, made tea for the women, and the men mixed gin and limes with tepid water. The consul apologized for proposing a toast in which they could not join. He begged to drink to those who had escaped the perils of the sea. Had they been his oldest and nearest friends, his little speech could not have been more heart-felt and sincere. To his distress, it moved one of the ladies to tears, and in embarrassment he turned to the men.\n",
      "\"I regret there is no ice,\" he said, \"but you know the rule of the tropics; as soon as a ship enters port, the ice- machine bursts.\"\n",
      "\"I'll tell the steward to send you some, sir,\" said Livingstone, \"and as long as we're here.\"\n",
      "The senator showed his concern.\n",
      "\"As long as we're here?\" he gasped.\n",
      "\"Not over two days,\" answered the owner nervously. \"The chief says it will take all of that to get her in shape. As you ought to know, Senator, she was pretty badly mauled.\"\n",
      "The senator gazed blankly out of the window. Beyond it lay the naked coral reefs, the empty sky, and the ragged palms of Porto Banos.\n",
      "Livingstone felt that his legation was slipping from him.\n",
      "\"That wireless operator,\" he continued hastily, \"tells me there is a most amusing place a few miles down the coast, Las Bocas, a sort of Coney Island, where the government people go for the summer. There's surf bathing and roulette and cafes chantants. He says there's some Spanish dancers--\"\n",
      "The guests of the SERAPIS exclaimed with interest; the senator smiled. To Marshall the general enthusiasm over the thought of a ride on a merry-go-round suggested that the friends of Mr. Livingstone had found their own society far from satisfying.\n",
      "Greatly encouraged, Livingstone continued, with enthusiasm:\n",
      "\"And that wireless man said,\" he added, \"that with the launch we can get there in half an hour. We might run down after dinner.\" He turned to Marshall.\n",
      "\"Will you join us, Mr. Consul?\" he asked, \"and dine with us, first?\"\n",
      "Marshall accepted with genuine pleasure. It had been many months since he had sat at table with his own people. But he shook his head doubtfully.\n",
      "\"I was wondering about Las Bocas,\" he explained, \"if your going there might not get you in trouble at the next port. With a yacht, I think it is different, but Las Bocas is under quarantine.\"\n",
      "There was a chorus of exclamations.\n",
      "\"It's not serious,\" Marshall explained. \"There was bubonic plague there, or something like it. You would be in no danger from that. It is only that you might be held up by the regulations. Passenger steamers can't land any one who has been there at any other port of the West Indies. The English are especially strict. The Royal Mail won't even receive any one on board here without a certificate from the English consul saying he has not visited Las Bocas. For an American they would require the same guarantee from me. But I don't think the regulations extend to yachts. I will inquire. I don't wish to deprive you of any of the many pleasures of Porto Banos,\" he added, smiling, \"but if you were refused a landing at your next port I would blame myself.\"\n",
      "\"It's all right,\" declared Livingstone decidedly. \"It's just as you say; yachts and warships are exempt. Besides, I carry my own doctor, and if he won't give us a clean bill of health, I'll make him walk the plank. At eight, then, at dinner. I'll send the cutter for you. I can't give you a salute, Mr. Consul, but you shall have all the side boys I can muster.\"\n",
      "Those from the yacht parted from their consul in the most friendly spirit.\n",
      "\"I think he's charming!\" exclaimed Miss Cairns. \"And did you notice his novels? They were in every language. It must be terribly lonely down here, for a man like that.\"\n",
      "\"He's the first of our consuls we've met on this trip,\" growled her father, \"that we've caught sober.\"\n",
      "\"Sober!\" exclaimed his wife indignantly.\n",
      "\"He's one of the Marshalls of Vermont. I asked him.\"\n",
      "\"I wonder,\" mused Hanley, \"how much the place is worth? Hamilton, one of the new senators, has been deviling the life out of me to send his son somewhere. Says if he stays in Washington he'll disgrace the family. I should think this place would drive any man to drink himself to death in three months, and young Hamilton, from what I've seen of him, ought to be able to do it in a week. That would leave the place open for the next man.\"\n",
      "\"There's a postmaster in my State thinks he carried it.\" The senator smiled grimly. \"He has consumption, and wants us to give him a consulship in the tropics. I'll tell him I've seen Porto Banos, and that it's just the place for him.\"\n",
      "The senator's pleasantry was not well received. But Miss Cairns alone had the temerity to speak of what the others were thinking.\n",
      "\"What would become of Mr. Marshall?\" she asked. The senator smiled tolerantly.\n",
      "\"I don't know that I was thinking of Mr. Marshall,\" he said. \"I can't recall anything he has done for this administration. You see, Miss Cairns,\" he explained, in the tone of one addressing a small child, \"Marshall has been abroad now for forty years, at the expense of the taxpayers. Some of us think men who have lived that long on their fellow-countrymen had better come home and get to work.\"\n",
      "Livingstone nodded solemnly in assent. He did not wish a post abroad at the expense of the taxpayers. He was willing to pay for it. And then, with \"ex-Minister\" on his visiting cards, and a sense of duty well performed, for the rest of his life he could join the other expatriates in Paris.\n",
      "Just before dinner, the cruiser RALEIGH having discovered the whereabouts of the SERAPIS by wireless, entered the harbor, and Admiral Hardy came to the yacht to call upon the senator, in whose behalf he had been scouring the Caribbean Seas. Having paid his respects to that personage, the admiral fell boisterously upon Marshall.\n",
      "The two old gentlemen were friends of many years. They had met, officially and unofficially, in many strange parts of the world. To each the chance reunion was a piece of tremendous good fortune. And throughout dinner the guests of Livingstone, already bored with each other, found in them and their talk of former days new and delightful entertainment. So much so that when, Marshall having assured them that the local quarantine regulations did not extend to a yacht, the men departed for Las Bocas, the women insisted that he and admiral remain behind.\n",
      "It was for Marshall a wondrous evening. To foregather with his old friend whom he had known since Hardy was a mad midshipman, to sit at the feet of his own charming countrywomen, to listen to their soft, modulated laughter, to note how quickly they saw that to him the evening was a great event, and with what tact each contributed to make it the more memorable; all served to wipe out the months of bitter loneliness, the stigma of failure, the sense of undeserved neglect. In the moonlight, on the cool quarter-deck, they sat, in a half-circle, each of the two friends telling tales out of school, tales of which the other was the hero or the victim, \"inside\" stories of great occasions, ceremonies, bombardments, unrecorded \"shirt-sleeve\" diplomacy.\n",
      "Hardy had helped to open the Suez Canal. Marshall had assisted the Queen of Madagascar to escape from the French invaders. On the Barbary Coast Hardy had chased pirates. In Edinburgh Marshall had played chess with Carlyle. He had seen Paris in mourning in the days of the siege, Paris in terror in the days of the Commune; he had known Garibaldi, Gambetta, the younger Dumas, the creator of Pickwick.\n",
      "\"Do you remember that time in Tangier,\" the admiral urged, when I was a midshipman, and got into the bashaw's harem?\"\n",
      "\"Do you remember how I got you out? Marshall replied grimly.\n",
      "\"And,\" demanded Hardy, \"do you remember when Adelina Patti paid a visit to the KEARSARGE at Marseilles in '65--George Dewey was our second officer--and you were bowing and backing away from her, and you backed into an open hatch, and she said 'my French isn't up to it' what was it she said?\"\n",
      "\"I didn't hear it,\" said Marshall; \"I was too far down the hatch.\"\n",
      "\"Do you mean the old KEARSARGE?\" asked Mrs. Cairns. \"Were you in the service then, Mr. Marshall? \"\n",
      "With loyal pride in his friend, the admiral answered for him:\n",
      "\"He was our consul-general at Marseilles!\"\n",
      "There was an uncomfortable moment. Even those denied imagination could not escape the contrast, could see in their mind's eye the great harbor of Marseilles, crowded with the shipping of the world, surrounding it the beautiful city, the rival of Paris to the north, and on the battleship the young consul-general making his bow to the young Empress of Song. And now, before their actual eyes, they saw the village of Porto Banos, a black streak in the night, a row of mud shacks, at the end of the wharf a single lantern yellow in the clear moonlight.\n",
      "Later in the evening Miss Cairns led the admiral to one side.\n",
      "\"Admiral,\" she began eagerly, \"tell me about your friend. Why is he here? Why don't they give him a place worthy of him? I've seen many of our representatives abroad, and I know we cannot afford to waste men like that.\" The girl exclaimed indignantly: \" He's one of the most interesting men I've ever met! He's lived everywhere, known every one. He's a distinguished man, a cultivated man; even I can see he knows his work, that he's a diplomat, born, trained, that he's--\" The admiral interrupted with a growl.\n",
      "\"You don't have to tell ME about Henry,\" he protested. \"I've known Henry twenty-five years. If Henry got his deserts,\" he exclaimed hotly, \"he wouldn't be a consul on this coral reef; he'd be a minister in Europe. Look at me! We're the same age. We started together. When Lincoln sent him to Morocco as consul, he signed my commission as a midshipman. Now I'm an admiral. Henry has twice my brains and he's been a consul-general, and he's HERE, back at the foot of the ladder!\"\n",
      "\"Why?\" demanded the girl.\n",
      "\"Because the navy is a service and the consular service isn't a service. Men like Senator Hanley use it to pay their debts. While Henry's been serving his country abroad, he's lost his friends, lost his 'pull.' Those politicians up at Washington have no use for him. They don't consider that a consul like Henry can make a million dollars for his countrymen. He can keep them from shipping goods where there's no market, show them where there is a market.\" The admiral snorted contemptuously. \"You don't have to tell ME the value of a good consul. But those politicians don't consider that. They only see that he has a job worth a few hundred dollars, and they want it, and if he hasn't other politicians to protect him, they'll take it.\" The girl raised her head.\n",
      "\"Why don't you speak to the senator?\" she asked. \"Tell him you've known him for years, that--\"\n",
      "\"Glad to do it!\" exclaimed the admiral heartily. \"It won't be the first time. But Henry mustn't know. He's too confoundedly touchy. He hates the IDEA of influence, hates men like Hanley, who abuse it. If he thought anything was given to him except on his merits, he wouldn't take it.\"\n",
      "\"Then we won't tell him, \" said the girl. For a moment she hesitated.\n",
      "\"If I spoke to Mr. Hanley,\" she asked, \"told him what I learned to-night of Mr. Marshall, \"would it have any effect?\"\n",
      "\"Don't know how it will affect Hanley, said the sailor, \"but if you asked me to make anybody a consul-general, I'd make him an ambassador.\"\n",
      "Later in the evening Hanley and Livingstone were seated alone on deck. The visit to Las Bocas had not proved amusing, but, much to Livingstone's relief, his honored guest was now in good-humor. He took his cigar from his lips, only to sip at a long cool drink. He was in a mood flatteringly confidential and communicative.\n",
      "\"People have the strangest idea of what I can do for them,\" he laughed. It was his pose to pretend he was without authority. \"They believe I've only to wave a wand, and get them anything they want. I thought I'd be safe from them on board a yacht.\"\n",
      "Livingstone, in ignorance of what was coming, squirmed apprehensively.\n",
      "\"But it seems,\" the senator went on, \" I'm at the mercy of a conspiracy. The women folk want me to do something for this fellow Marshall. If they had their way, they'd send him to the Court of St. James. And old Hardy, too, tackled me about him. So did Miss Cairns.\n",
      "And then Marshall himself got me behind the wheel-house, and I thought he was going to tell me how good he was, too! But he didn't.\"\n",
      "As though the joke were on himself, the senator laughed appreciatively.\n",
      "\"Told me, instead, that Hardy ought to be a vice-admiral.\"\n",
      "Livingstone, also, laughed, with the satisfied air of one who cannot be tricked.\n",
      "\"They fixed it up between them,\" he explained, \"each was to put in a good word for the other.\" He nodded eagerly. \"That's what I think.\"\n",
      "There were moments during the cruise when Senator Hanley would have found relief in dropping his host overboard. With mock deference, the older man inclined his head.\n",
      "\"That's what you think, is it?\" he asked. \"Livingstone,\" he added, \"you certainly are a great judge of men!\"\n",
      "The next morning, old man Marshall woke with a lightness at his heart that had been long absent. For a moment, conscious only that he was happy, he lay between sleep and waking, frowning up at his canopy of mosquito net, trying to realize what change had come to him. Then he remembered. His old friend had returned. New friends had come into his life and welcomed him kindly. He was no longer lonely. As eager as a boy, he ran to the window. He had not been dreaming. In the harbor lay the pretty yacht, the stately, white-hulled war- ship. The flag that drooped from the stern of each caused his throat to tighten, brought warm tears to his eyes, fresh resolve to his discouraged, troubled spirit. When he knelt beside his bed, his heart poured out his thanks in gratitude and gladness.\n",
      "While he was dressing, a blue-jacket brought a note from the admiral. It invited him to tea on board the war-ship, with the guests of the SERAPIS. His old friend added that he was coming to lunch with his consul, and wanted time reserved for a long talk. The consul agreed gladly. He was in holiday humor. The day promised to repeat the good moments of the night previous.\n",
      "At nine o'clock, through the open door of the consulate, Marshall saw Aiken, the wireless operator, signaling from the wharf excitedly to the yacht, and a boat leave the ship and return. Almost immediately the launch, carrying several passengers, again made the trip shoreward.\n",
      "Half an hour later, Senator Hanley, Miss Cairns, and Livingstone came up the waterfront, and entering the consulate, seated themselves around Marshall's desk. Livingstone was sunk in melancholy. The senator, on the contrary, was smiling broadly. His manner was one of distinct relief. He greeted the consul with hearty good-humor.\n",
      "\"I'm ordered home!\" he announced gleefully. Then, remembering the presence of Livingstone, he hastened to add: \"I needn't say how sorry I am to give up my yachting trip, but orders are orders. The President,\" he explained to Marshall, \" cables me this morning to come back and take my coat off.\" The prospect, as a change from playing bridge on a pleasure boat, seemed far from depressing him.\n",
      "\"Those filibusters in the Senate,\" he continued genially, \"are making trouble again. They think they've got me out of the way for another month, but they'll find they're wrong. When that bill comes up, they'll find me at the old stand and ready for business!\" Marshall did not attempt to conceal his personal disappointment.\n",
      "\"I am so sorry you are leaving,\" he said; \"selfishly sorry, I mean. I'd hoped you all would be here for several days.\" He looked inquiringly toward Livingstone.\n",
      "\"I understood the SERAPIS was disabled,\" he explained.\n",
      "\"She is,\" answered Hanley. \"So's the RALEIGH. At a pinch, the admiral might have stretched the regulations and carried me to Jamaica, but the RALEIGH's engines are knocked about too. I've GOT to reach Kingston Thursday. The German boat leaves there Thursday for New York. At first it looked as though I couldn't do it, but we find that the Royal Mail is due to-day, and she can get to Kingston Wednesday night. It's a great piece of luck. I wouldn't bother you with my troubles, \"the senator explained pleasantly, \"but the agent of the Royal Mail here won't sell me a ticket until you've put your seal to this.\" He extended a piece of printed paper.\n",
      "As Hanley had been talking, the face of the consul had grown grave. He accepted the paper, but did not look at it. Instead, he regarded the senator with troubled eyes. When he spoke, his tone was one of genuine concern.\n",
      "\"It is most unfortunate,\" he said. \"But I am afraid the ROYAL MAIL will not take you on board. Because of Las Bocas,\" he explained. \"If we had only known!\" he added remorsefully. \"It is MOST unfortunate.\"\n",
      "\"Because of Las Bocas?\" echoed Hanley.\n",
      "\"You don't mean they'll refuse to take me to Jamaica because I spent half an hour at the end of a wharf listening to a squeaky gramophone?\"\n",
      "\"The trouble,\" explained Marshall, \"is this: if they carried you, all the other passengers would be held in quarantine for ten days, and there are fines to pay, and there would be difficulties over the mails. But,\" he added hopefully, \"maybe the regulations have been altered. I will see her captain, and tell him--\"\n",
      "\"See her captain!\" objected Hanley. \"Why see the captain? He doesn't know I've been to that place. Why tell him? All I need is a clean bill of health from you. That's all HE wants. You have only to sign that paper.\" Marshall regarded the senator with surprise.\n",
      "\"But I can't,\" he said.\n",
      "\"You can't? Why not?\"\n",
      "\"Because it certifies to the fact that you have not visited Las Bocas. Unfortunately, you have visited Las Bocas.\"\n",
      "The senator had been walking up and down the room. Now he seated himself, and stared at Marshall curiously.\n",
      "\"It's like this, Mr. Marshall,\" he began quietly. \"The President desires my presence in Washington, thinks I can be of some use to him there in helping carry out certain party measures--measures to which he pledged himself before his election. Down here, a British steamship line has laid down local rules which, in my case anyway, are ridiculous. The question is, are you going to be bound by the red tape of a ha'penny British colony, or by your oath to the President of the United States?\"\n",
      "The sophistry amused Marshall. He smiled good-naturedly and shook his head.\n",
      "\"I'm afraid, Senator,\" he said, \"that way of putting it is hardly fair. Unfortunately, the question is one of fact. I will explain to the captain--\"\n",
      "\"You will explain nothing to the captain!\" interrupted Hanley. \"This is a matter which concerns no one but our two selves. I am not asking favors of steamboat captains. I am asking an American consul to assist an American citizen in trouble, and, \"he added, with heavy sarcasm, \"incidentally, to carry out the wishes of his President.\"\n",
      "Marshall regarded the senator with an expression of both surprise and disbelief.\n",
      "\"Are you asking me to put my name to what is not so?\" he said. \"Are you serious?\"\n",
      "\"That paper, Mr. Marshall,\" returned Hanley steadily, \"is a mere form, a piece of red tape. There's no more danger of my carrying the plague to Jamaica than of my carrying a dynamite bomb. You KNOW that.\"\n",
      "\"I DO know that,\" assented Marshall heartily.\"I appreciate your position, and I regret it exceedingly. You are the innocent victim of a regulation which is a wise regulation, but which is most unfair to you. My own position,\" he added, \"is not important, but you can believe me, it is not easy. It is certainly no pleasure for me to be unable to help you.\"\n",
      "Hanley was leaning forward, his hands on his knees, his eyes watching Marshall closely. \"Then you refuse?\" he said. \"Why?\"\n",
      "Marshall regarded the senator steadily. His manner was untroubled. The look he turned upon Hanley was one of grave disapproval.\n",
      "\"You know why,\" he answered quietly. \"It is impossible.\"\n",
      "In sudden anger Hanley rose. Marshall, who had been seated behind his desk, also rose. For a moment, in silence, the two men confronted each other. Then Hanley spoke; his tone was harsh and threatening.\n",
      "\"Then I am to understand,\" he exclaimed, \"that you refuse to carry out the wishes of a United States Senator and of the President of the United States?\"\n",
      "In front of Marshall, on his desk, was the little iron stamp of the consulate. Protectingly, almost caressingly, he laid his hand upon it.\n",
      "\"I refuse,\" he corrected, \"to place the seal of this consulate on a lie.\"\n",
      "There was a moment's pause. Miss Cairns, unwilling to remain, and unable to withdraw, clasped her hands unhappily and stared at the floor. Livingstone exclaimed in indignant protest. Hanley moved a step nearer and, to emphasize what he said, tapped his knuckles on the desk. With the air of one confident of his advantage, he spoke slowly and softly.\n",
      "\"Do you appreciate,\" he asked, \"that, while you may be of some importance down here in this fever swamp, in Washington I am supposed to carry some weight? Do you appreciate that I am a senator from a State that numbers four millions of people, and that you are preventing me from serving those people?\" Marshall inclined his head gravely and politely. \"And I want you to appreciate,\" he said, \"that while I have no weight at Washington, in this fever swamp I have the honor to represent eighty millions of people, and as long as that consular sign is over my door I don't intend to prostitute it for YOU, or the President of the United States, or any one of those eighty millions.\"\n",
      "Of the two men, the first to lower his eyes was Hanley. He laughed shortly, and walked to the door. There he turned, and indifferently, as though the incident no longer interested him, drew out his watch.\n",
      "\"Mr. Marshall,\" he said, \"if the cable is working, I'll take your tin sign away from you by sunset.\"\n",
      "For one of Marshall's traditions, to such a speech there was no answer save silence. He bowed, and, apparently serene and undismayed, resumed his seat. From the contest, judging from the manner of each, it was Marshall, not Hanley, who had emerged victorious.\n",
      "But Miss Cairns was not deceived. Under the unexpected blow, Marshall had turned older. His clear blue eyes had grown less alert, his broad shoulders seemed to stoop. In sympathy, her own eyes filled with sudden tears.\n",
      "\"What will you do?\" she whispered.\n",
      "\"I don't know what I shall do,\" said Marshall simply. \"I should have liked to have resigned. It's a prettier finish. After forty years--to be dismissed by cable is--it's a poor way of ending it.\"\n",
      "Miss Cairns rose and walked to the door. There she turned and looked back.\n",
      "\"I am sorry,\" she said. And both understood that in saying no more than that she had best shown her sympathy.\n",
      "An hour later the sympathy of Admiral Hardy was expressed more directly.\n",
      "\"If he comes on board my ship,\" roared that gentleman, \"I'll push him down an ammunition hoist and break his damned neck!\"\n",
      "Marshall laughed delightedly. The loyalty of his old friend was never so welcome.\n",
      "\"You'll treat him with every courtesy,\" he said. \"The only satisfaction he gets out of this is to see that he has hurt me. We will not give him that satisfaction.\"\n",
      "But Marshall found that to conceal his wound was more difficult than he had anticipated. When, at tea time, on the deck of the war-ship, he again met Senator Hanley and the guests of the SERAPIS, he could not forget that his career had come to an end. There was much to remind him that this was so. He was made aware of it by the sad, sympathetic glances of the women; by their tactful courtesies; by the fact that Livingstone, anxious to propitiate Hanley, treated him rudely; by the sight of the young officers, each just starting upon a career of honor, and possible glory, as his career ended in humiliation; and by the big war-ship herself, that recalled certain crises when he had only to press a button and war-ships had come at his bidding.\n",
      "At five o'clock there was an awkward moment. The Royal Mail boat, having taken on her cargo, passed out of the harbor on her way to Jamaica, and dipped her colors. Senator Hanley, abandoned to his fate, observed her departure in silence.\n",
      "Livingstone, hovering at his side, asked sympathetically: \"Have they answered your cable, sir?\" \"They have,\" said Hanley gruffly.\n",
      "\"Was it--was it satisfactory?\" pursued the diplomat. \"It WAS,\" said the senator, with emphasis.\n",
      "Far from discouraged, Livingstone continued his inquiries.\n",
      "\"And when,\" he asked eagerly, \"are you going to tell him?\"\n",
      "\"Now!\" said the senator.\n",
      "The guests were leaving the ship. When all were seated in the admiral's steam launch, the admiral descended the accommodation ladder and himself picked up the tiller ropes.\n",
      "\"Mr. Marshall,\" he called, \"when I bring the launch broadside to the ship and stop her, you will stand ready to receive the consul's salute.\"\n",
      "Involuntarily, Marshall uttered an exclamation of protest. He had forgotten that on leaving the war-ship, as consul, he was entitled to seven guns. Had he remembered, he would have insisted that the ceremony be omitted. He knew that the admiral wished to show his loyalty, knew that his old friend was now paying him this honor only as a rebuke to Hanley. But the ceremony was no longer an honor. Hanley had made of it a mockery. It served only to emphasize what had been taken from him. But, without a scene, it now was too late to avoid it. The first of the seven guns had roared from the bow, and, as often he had stood before, as never he would so stand again, Marshall took his place at the gangway of the launch. His eyes were fixed on the flag, his gray head was uncovered, his hat was pressed above his heart.\n",
      "For the first time since Hanley had left the consulate, he fell into sudden terror lest he might give way to his emotions. Indignant at the thought, he held himself erect. His face was set like a mask, his eyes were untroubled. He was determined they should not see that he was suffering.\n",
      "Another gun spat out a burst of white smoke, a stab of flame. There was an echoing roar. Another and another followed. Marshall counted seven, and then, with a bow to the admiral, backed from the gangway.\n",
      "And then another gun shattered the hot, heavy silence. Marshall, confused, embarrassed, assuming he had counted wrong, hastily returned to his place. But again before he could leave it, in savage haste a ninth gun roared out its greeting. He could not still be mistaken. He turned appealingly to his friend. The eyes of the admiral were fixed upon the war-ship. Again a gun shattered the silence. Was it a jest? Were they laughing at him? Marshall flushed miserably. He gave a swift glance toward the others. They were smiling. Then it was a jest. Behind his back, something of which they all were cognizant was going forward. The face of Livingstone alone betrayed a like bewilderment to his own. But the others, who knew, were mocking him.\n",
      "For the thirteenth time a gun shook the brooding swamp land of Porto Banos. And then, and not until then, did the flag crawl slowly from the mast-head. Mary Cairns broke the tenseness by bursting into tears. But Marshall saw that every one else, save she and Livingstone, were still smiling. Even the bluejackets in charge of the launch were grinning at him. He was beset by smiling faces. And then from the war-ship, unchecked, came, against all regulations, three long, splendid cheers.\n",
      "Marshall felt his lips quivering, the warm tears forcing their way to his eyes. He turned beseechingly to his friend. His voice trembled.\n",
      "\"Charles,\" he begged, \"are they laughing at me?\"\n",
      "Eagerly, before the other would answer, Senator Hanley tossed his cigar into the water and, scrambling forward, seized Marshall by the hand.\n",
      "\"Mr. Marshall,\" he cried, \"our President has great faith in Abraham Lincoln's judgment of men. And this salute means that this morning he appointed you our new minister to The Hague. I'm one of those politicians who keeps his word. I TOLD YOU I'd take your tin sign away from you by sunset. I've done it!\"\n",

I needn't say that he lived in a castle, because that's of course; neither need I say that he lived in an old castle; for what German baron ever lived in a new one?  There were many strange circumstances connected with this venerable building, among which, not the least startling and mysterious were, that when the wind blew, it rumbled in the chimneys, or even howled among the trees in the neighboring forest; and that when the moon shone, she found her way through certain small loopholes in the wall, and actually made some parts of the wide halls and galleries quite light, while she left others in gloomy shadow.  I believe that one of the baron's ancestors, being short of money, had inserted a dagger in a gentleman who called one night to ask his way, and it was supposed that these miraculous occurrences took place in consequence.  And yet I hardly know how that could have been, either, because the baron's ancestor, who was an amiable man, felt very sorry afterwards for having been so rash, and laying violent hands upon a quantity of stone and timber which belonged to a weaker baron, built a chapel as an apology, and so took a receipt from Heaven, in full of all demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking of the baron's ancestor puts me in mind of the baron's great claims to respect, on the score of his pedigree.  I am afraid to say, I am sure, how many ancestors the baron had; but I know that he had a great many more than any other man of his time; and I only wish that he had lived in these latter days, that he might have had more.  It is a very hard thing upon the great men of past centuries, that they should have come into the world so soon, because a man who was born three or four hundred years ago, cannot reasonably be expected to have had as many relations before him, as a man who is born now. The last man, whoever he is - and he may be a cobbler or some low vulgar dog for aught we know - will have a longer pedigree than the greatest nobleman now alive; and I contend that this is not fair.\n",
      "Well, but the Baron Von Koëldwethout of Grogzwig!  He was a fine swarthy fellow, with dark hair and large moustachios, who rode a-hunting in clothes of Lincoln green, with russet boots on his feet, and a bugle slung over his shoulder, like the guard of a long stage.  When he blew this bugle, four-and-twenty other gentlemen of inferior rank, in Lincoln green a little coarser, and russet boots with a little thicker soles, turned out directly; and away galloped the whole train, with spears in their hands like lackered area railings, to hunt down the boars, or perhaps encounter a bear:  in which latter case the baron killed him first, and greased his whiskers with him afterwards.\n",
      "This was a merry life for the Baron of Grogzwig, and a merrier still for the baron's retainers, who drank Rhine wine every night till they fell under the table, and then had the bottles on the floor, and called for pipes. Never were such jolly, roystering, rollicking, merry-making blades, as the jovial crew of Grogzwig.\n",
      "But the pleasures of the table, or the pleasures of under the table, require a little variety; especially when the same five-and-twenty people sit daily down to the same board, to discuss the same subjects, and tell the same stories.  The baron grew weary, and wanted excitement.  He took to quarrelling with his gentlemen, and tried kicking two or three of them every day after dinner.  This was a pleasant change at first; but it became monotonous after a week or so, and the baron felt quite out of sorts, and cast about, in despair, for some new amusement.\n",
      "One night, after a day's sport in which he had outdone Nimrod or Gillingwater, and slaughtered \"another fine bear\", and brought him home in triumph, the Baron Von Koëldwethout sat moodily at the head of his table, eyeing the smoky roof of the hall with a discontented aspect.  He swallowed huge bumpers of wine, but the more he swallowed, the more he frowned.  The gentlemen who had been honoured with the dangerous distinction of sitting on his right and left, imitated him to a miracle in the drinking, and frowned at each other.\n",
      "\"I will!\" cried the baron suddenly, smiting the table with his right hand, and twirling his moustache with his left.  \"Fill to the Lady of Grogzwig!\"\n",
      "The four-and-twenty Lincoln greens turned pale, with the exception of their four-and-twenty noses, which were unchangeable.\n",
      "\"I said to the Lady of Grogzwig,\" repeated the baron, looking round the board.\n",
      "\"To the Lady of Grogzwig!\" shouted the Lincoln greens; and down their four-and-twenty throats went four-and-twenty imperial pints of such rare old hock, that they smacked their eight-and-forty lips, and winked again.\n",
      "\"The fair daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen,\" said Koëldwethout, condescending to explain.  \"We will demand her in marriage of her father, ere the sun goes down tomorrow.  If he refuse our suit, we will cut off his nose.\"\n",
      "A hoarse murmur arose from the company; every man touched, first the hilt of his sword, and then the tip of his nose, with appalling significance.\n",
      "What a pleasant thing filial piety is, to contemplate!  If the daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen had pleaded a preoccupied heart, or fallen at her father's feet and corned them in salt tears, or only fainted away, and complimented the old gentleman in frantic ejaculations, the odds are a hundred to one, but Swillenhausen castle would have been turned out at window, or rather the baron turned out at window, and the castle demolished.  The damsel held her peace, however, when an early messenger bore the request of Von Koëldwethout next morning, and modestly retired to her chamber, from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue.  She was no sooner assured that the horseman with the large moustachios was her proferred husband, than she hastened to her father's presence, and expressed her readiness to sacrifice herself to secure his peace.  The venerable baron caught his child into his arms, and shed a wink of joy.\n",
      "There was a great feasting at the castle, that day.  The four-and-twenty Lincoln greens of Von Koëldwethout exchanged vows of eternal friendship with twelve Lincoln greens of Von Swillenhausen, and promised the old baron that they would drink his wine \"Till all was blue\" - meaning probably until their whole countenances had acquired the same tint as their noses. Everybody slapped everybody else's back, when the time for parting came; and the Baron Von Koëldwethout and his followers rode gaily home.\n",
      "For six mortal weeks, the bears and boars had a holiday.  The houses of Koëldwethout and Swillenhausen were united; the spears rusted; and the baron's bugle grew hoarse for lack of blowing.\n",
      "Those were great times for the four-and-twenty; but, alas!  their high and palmy days had taken boots to themselves, and were already walking off.\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said the baroness.\n",
      "\"My love,\" said the baron.\n",
      "\"Those coarse, noisy men--\"\n",
      "\"Which, ma'am?\" said the baron starting.\n",
      "The baroness pointed, from the window at which they stood, to the courtyard beneath, where the unconscious Lincoln greens were taking a copious stirrup-cup, preparatory to issuing forth, after a boar or two.\n",
      "\"My hunting train, ma'am,\" said the baron.\n",
      "\"Disband them, love,\" murmured the baroness.\n",
      "\"Disband them!\" cried the baron, in amazement.\n",
      "\"To please me, love,\" replied the baroness.\n",
      "\"To please the devil, ma'am,\" answered the baron.\n",
      "Whereupon the baroness uttered a great cry, and swooned away at the baron's feet.\n",
      "What could the baron do?  He called for the lady's maid, and roared for the doctor; and then, rushing into the yard, kicked the two Lincoln greens who were the most used to it, and cursing the others all round, bade them go - but never mind where, I don't know the German for it, or I would put it delicately that way.\n",
      "It is not for me to say by what means or by what degrees, some wives manage to keep down some husbands as they do, although I may have my private opinion on the subject, and may think that no Member of Parliament ought to be married, inasmuch as three married members out of every four, must vote according to their wives' consciences if there be such things, and not according to their own.  All I need say, just now, is, that the Baroness Von Koëldwethout somehow or other acquired great control over the Baron Von Koëldwethout, and that, little by little, and bit by bit, and day by day, and year by year, the baron got the worst of some disputed question, or was slily unhorsed from some old hobby; and that by the time he was a fat hearty fellow of forty-eight or thereabouts, he had no feasting, no revelry, no hunting train, and no hunting - nothing in short that he liked, or used to have; and that, although he was as fierce as a lion and as bold as brass, he was decidedly snubbed and put down, by his own lady, in his own castle of Grogzwig.\n",
      "Nor was this the whole extent of the baron's misfortunes.  About a year after his nuptials, there came into the world a lusty young baron, in whose honour a great many fireworks were let off, and a great many dozens of wine drunk; but next year there came a young baroness, and next year another young baron, and so on, every year, either a baron or baroness and one year both together, until the baron found himself the father of a small family of twelve.  Upon every one of these anniversaries, the venerable Baroness Von Swillenhausen was nervously sensitive for the well-being of her child the Baroness Von Koëldwethout and although it was not found that the good lady ever did anything material towards contributing to her child's recovery, still she made it a point of duty to be as nervous as possible at the castle at Grogzwig, and to divide her time between moral observations on the baron's housekeeping, and bewailing the hard lot of her unhappy daughter.  And if the Baron of Grogzwig, a little hurt and irritated at this, took heart, and ventured to suggest that his wife was at least no worse off than the wives of other barons, the Baroness Von Swillenhausen begged all persons to take notice, that nobody but she, sympathized with her dear daughter's sufferings; upon which, her relations and friends remarked, that to be sure she did cry a great deal more than her son-in-law, and that if there were a hard-hearted brute alive, it was that Baron of Grogzwig.\n",
      "The poor baron bore it all, as long as he could, and when he could bear it no longer lost his appetite and his spirits, and sat himself gloomily and dejectedly down.  But there were worse troubles yet in store for him, and as they came on, his melancholy and sadness increased. Times changed. He got into debt. The Grogzwig coffers ran low, though the Swillenhausen family had looked upon them as inexhaustible; and just when the baroness was on the point of making a thirteenth addition to the family pedigree, Von Koëldwethout discovered that he had no means of replenishing them.\n",
      "\"I don't see what is to be done,\" said the baron. \"I think I'll kill myself.\"\n",
      "This was a bright idea.  The baron took an old hunting-knife from a cupboard hard by, and having sharpened it on his boot, made what boys call \"an offer\" at his throat.\n",
      "\"Hem!\" said the baron, stopping short.  \"Perhaps it's not sharp enough.\"\n",
      "The baron sharpened it again, and made another offer, when his hand was arrested by a loud screaming among the young barons and baronesses, who had a nursery in an upstairs tower with iron bars outside the window, to prevent their tumbling out into the moat.\n",
      "\"If I had been a bachelor,\" said the baron sighing, \"I might have done it fifty times over, without being interrupted.  Hallo!  Put a flask of wine and the largest pipe, in the little vaulted room behind the hall.\"\n",
      "One of the domestics, in a very kind manner, executed the baron's order in the course of half an hour or so, and Von Koëldwethout being apprised thereof, strode to the vaulted room, the walls of which, being of dark shining wood, gleamed in the light of the blazing logs which were piled upon the hearth.  The bottle and pipe were ready, and, upon the whole, the place looked very comfortable.\n",
      "\"Leave the lamp,\" said the baron.\n",
      "\"Anything else, my lord?\" inquired the domestic.\n",
      "\"The room,\" replied the baron.  The domestic obeyed, and the baron locked the door.\n",
      "\"I'll smoke a last pipe,\" said the baron, \"and then I'll be off.\"  So, putting the knife upon the table till he wanted it, and tossing off a goodly measure of wine, the Lord of Grogzwig threw himself back in his chair, stretched his legs out before the fire, and puffed away.\n",
      "He thought about a great many things - about his present troubles and past days of bachelorship, and about the Lincoln greens, long since disappeared up and down the country, no one knew whither:  with the exception of two who had been unfortunately beheaded, and four who had killed themselves with drinking.  His mind was running upon bears and boars, when, in the process of draining his glass to the bottom, he raised his eyes, and saw, for the first time and with unbounded astonishment, that he was not alone.\n",
      "No, he was not; for, on the opposite side of the fire, there sat with folded arms a wrinkled hideous figure, with deeply sunk and bloodshot eyes, and an immensely long, cadaverous face, shadowed by jagged and matted locks of coarse black hair.  He wore a kind of tunic of a dull bluish colour, which, the baron observed, on regarding it attentively, was clasped or ornamented down the front, with coffin handles.  His legs too, were encased in coffin plates as though in armour; and over his left shoulder he wore a short dusky cloak, which seemed made of remnant of some pall.  He took no notice of the baron, but was intently eyeing the fire.\n",
      "\"Halloa!\" said the baron, stamping his foot to attract attention.\n",
      "\"Halloa!\" replied the stranger, moving his eyes towards the baron, but not his face or himself.  \"What now?\"\n",
      "\"What now?\" replied the baron, nothing daunted by his hollow voice and lustreless eyes, \"I should ask that question.  How did you get here?\"\n",
      "\"Through the door,\" replied the figure.\n",
      "\"What are you?\" says the baron.\n",
      "\"A man,\" replied the figure.\n",
      "\"I don't believe it,\" says the baron.\n",
      "\"Disbelieve it then,\" says the figure.\n",
      "\"I will,\" rejoined the baron.\n",
      "The figure looked at the bold Baron of Grogzwig for some time, and then said familiarly,\n",
      "\"There's no coming over you, I see.  I'm not a man!\"\n",
      "\"What are you then?\" asked the baron.\n",
      "\"A genius,\" replied the figure.\n",
      "\"You don't look much like one,\" returned the baron scornfully.\n",
      "\"I am the Genius of Despair and Suicide,\" said the apparition.  \"Now you know me.\"\n",
      "With these words the apparition turned towards the baron, as if composing himself for a talk - and, what was very remarkable, was, that he threw his cloak aside, and displaying a stake, which was run through the centre of his body, pulled it out with a jerk, and laid it on the table, as composedly as if it had been a walking-stick.\n",
      "\"Now,\" said the figure, glancing at the hunting-knife, \"are you ready for me?\"\n",
      "\"Not quite,\" rejoined the baron; \"I must finish this pipe first.\"\n",
      "\"Look sharp then,\" said the figure.\n",
      "You seem in a hurry,\" said the baron.\n",
      "\"Why, yes, I am,\" answered the figure; \"they're doing a pretty brisk business in my way, over in England and France just now, and my time is a good deal taken up.\"\n",
      "\"Do you drink?\" said the baron, touching the bottle with the bowl of his pipe.\n",
      "\"Nine times out of ten, and then very hard,\" rejoined the figure, drily.\n",
      "\"Never in moderation?\" asked the baron.\n",
      "\"Never,\" replied the figure, with a shudder, \"that breeds cheerfulness.\"\n",
      "The baron took another look at his new friend, whom he thought an uncommonly queer customer, and at length inquired whether he took any active part in such little proceedings as that which he had in contemplation.\n",
      "\"No,\" replied the figure evasively; \"but I am always present.\"\n",
      "\"Just to see fair, I suppose?\" said the baron.\n",
      "\"Just that,\" replied the figure playing with the stake, and examining the ferule.\n",
      "\"Be as quick as you can, will you, for there's a young gentleman who is afflicted with too much money and leisure wanting me now, I find.\"\n",
      "\"Going to kill himself because he has too much money!\" exclaimed the baron, quite tickled:  \"Ha! ha! that's a good one.\"  This was the first time the baron had laughed for many a long day.\n",
      "\"I say,\" expostulated the figure, looking very much scared; \"don't do that again.\"\n",
      "\"Why not?\" demanded the baron.\n",
      "\"Because it gives me pain all over,\" replied the figure.  \"Sigh as much as you please; that does me good.\"\n",
      "The baron sighed mechanically, at the mention of the word; the figure, brightening up again, handed him the hunting-knife with the most winning politeness.\n",
      "\"It's not a bad idea though,\" said the baron, feeling the edge of the weapon; \"a man killing himself because he has too much money.\"\n",
      "\"Pooh!\" said the apparition, petulantly, \"no better than a man's killing himself because he has none or little.\"\n",
      "Whether the genius unintentionally committed himself in saying this, or whether he thought the baron's mind was so thoroughly made up that it didn't matter what he said, I have no means of knowing.  I only know that the baron stopped his hand, all of a sudden, opened his eyes wide, and looked as if quite a new light had come upon him for the first time.\n",
      "\"Why, certainly,\" said Von Koëldwethout, \"nothing is too bad to be retrieved.\"\n",
      "\"Except empty coffers,\" cried the genius.\n",
      "\"Well, but they may be one day filled again,\" said the baron.\n",
      "\"Scolding wives,\" snarled the genius.\n",
      "\"Oh!  They may be made quiet,\" said the baron.\n",
      "\"Thirteen children,\" shouted the genius.\n",
      "\"Can't all go wrong, surely,\" said the baron.\n",
      "The genius was evidently growing very savage with the baron, for holding these opinions all at once; but he tried to laugh it off, and said if he would let him know when he had left off joking, he should feel obliged to him.\n",
      "\"But I am not joking; I was never farther from it,\" remonstrated the baron.\n",
      "\"Well, I am glad to hear that,\" said the genius, looking very grim, \"because a joke, without any figure of speech, is the death of me.  come!  Quit this dreary world at once.\"\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said the baron, playing with the knife; \"it's a dreary one certainly, but I don't think yours is much better, for you have not the appearance of being particularly comfortable.  That puts me in mind - what security have I, that I shall be any the better for going out of the world after all!\" he cried, starting up; \"I never thought of that.\"\n",
      "\"Dispatch,\" cried the figure, gnashing its teeth.\n",
      "\"Keep off!\" said the baron, \"I'll brood over miseries no longer, but put a good face on the matter, and try the fresh air and the bears again; and if that don't do, I'll talk to the baroness soundly, and cut the Von Swillenhausens dead.\"  With this the baron fell into his chair, and laughed so loud and boisterously, that the room rang with it.\n",
      "The figure fell back a pace or two, regarding the baron meanwhile with a look of intense terror, and when he had ceased, caught up the stake, plunged it violently into its body, uttered a frightful howl, and disappeared.\n",
      "Von Koëldwethout never saw it again.  Having once made up his mind to action, he soon brought the baroness and the Von Swillenhausens to reason, and died many years afterwards; not a rich man that I am aware of, but certainly a happy one:  leaving behind him a numerous family, who had been carefully educated in bear- and boar-hunting under his own personal eye.  And my advice to all men is, that if ever they become hipped and melancholy from similar causes as very many men do, they look at both sides of the question, applying a magnifying glass to the best one; and if they still feel tempted to retire without leave, that they smoke a large pipe and drink a full bottle first, and profit by the laudable example of the baron of Grogzwig.\n",

      "He was very reluctant to take precedence of so many respected members of the family, by beginning the round of stories they were to relate as they sat in a goodly circle by the Christmas fire; and he modestly suggested that it would be more correct if \"John our esteemed host\" (whose health he begged to drink) would have the kindness to begin. For as to himself, he said, he was so little used to lead the way that really--But as they all cried out here, that he must begin, and agreed with one voice that he might, could, would, and should begin, he left off rubbing his hands, and took his legs out from under his armchair, and did begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no doubt (said the poor relation) that I shall surprise the assembled members of our family, and particularly John our esteemed host to whom we are so much indebted for the great hospitality with which he has this day entertained us, by the confession I am going to make. But, if you do me the honour to be surprised at anything that falls from a person so unimportant in the family as I am, I can only say that I shall be scrupulously accurate in all I relate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not what I am supposed to be. I am quite another thing. Perhaps before I go further, I had better glance at what I AM supposed to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is supposed, unless I mistake--the assembled members of our family will correct me if I do, which is very likely (here the poor relation looked mildly about him for contradiction); that I am nobody's enemy but my own. That I never met with any particular success in anything. That I failed in business because I was unbusiness-like and credulous--in not being prepared for the interested designs of my partner. That I failed in love, because I was ridiculously trustful--in thinking it impossible that Christiana could deceive me. That I failed in my expectations from my uncle Chill, on account of not being as sharp as he could have wished in worldly matters. That, through life, I have been rather put upon and disappointed in a general way. That I am at present a bachelor of between fifty-nine and sixty years of age, living on a limited income in the form of a quarterly allowance, to which I see that John our esteemed host wishes me to make no further allusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supposition as to my present pursuits and habits is to the following effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I live in a lodging in the Clapham Road--a very clean back room, in a very respectable house--where I am expected not to be at home in the day-time, unless poorly; and which I usually leave in the morning at nine o'clock, on pretence of going to business. I take my breakfast--my roll and butter, and my half-pint of coffee--at the old-established coffee-shop near Westminster Bridge; and then I go into the City--I don't know why--and sit in Garraway's Coffee House, and on 'Change, and walk about, and look into a few offices and counting-houses where some of my relations or acquaintance are so good as to tolerate me, and where I stand by the fire if the weather happens to be cold. I get through the day in this way until five o'clock, and then I dine: at a cost, on the average, of one and threepence. Having still a little money to spend on my evening's entertainment, I look into the old-established coffee-shop as I go home, and take my cup of tea, and perhaps my bit of toast. So, as the large hand of the clock makes its way round to the morning hour again, I make my way round to the Clapham Road again, and go to bed when I get to my lodging--fire being expensive, and being objected to by the family on account of its giving trouble and making a dirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, one of my relations or acquaintances is so obliging as to ask me to dinner. Those are holiday occasions, and then I generally walk in the Park. I am a solitary man, and seldom walk with anybody. Not that I am avoided because I am shabby; for I am not at all shabby, having always a very good suit of black on (or rather Oxford mixture, which has the appearance of black and wears much better); but I have got into a habit of speaking low, and being rather silent, and my spirits are not high, and I am sensible that I am not an attractive companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only exception to this general rule is the child of my first cousin, Little Frank. I have a particular affection for that child, and he takes very kindly to me. He is a diffident boy by nature; and in a crowd he is soon run over, as I may say, and forgotten. He and I, however, get on exceedingly well. I have a fancy that the poor child will in time succeed to my peculiar position in the family. We talk but little; still, we understand each other. We walk about, hand in hand; and without much speaking he knows what I mean, and I know what he means. When he was very little indeed, I used to take him to the windows of the toy-shops, and show him the toys inside. It is surprising how soon he found out that I would have made him a great many presents if I had been in circumstances to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Frank and I go and look at the outside of the Monument--he is very fond of the Monument--and at the Bridges, and at all the sights that are free. On two of my birthdays, we have dined on e-la-mode beef, and gone at half-price to the play, and been deeply interested. I was once walking with him in Lombard Street, which we often visit on account of my having mentioned to him that there are great riches there--he is very fond of Lombard Street--when a gentleman said to me as he passed by, \"Sir, your little son has dropped his glove.\" I assure you, if you will excuse my remarking on so trivial a circumstance, this accidental mention of the child as mine, quite touched my heart and brought the foolish tears into my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Little Frank is sent to school in the country, I shall be very much at a loss what to do with myself, but I have the intention of walking down there once a month and seeing him on a half holiday. I am told he will then be at play upon the Heath; and if my visits should be objected to, as unsettling the child, I can see him from a distance without his seeing me, and walk back again. His mother comes of a highly genteel family, and rather disapproves, I am aware, of our being too much together. I know that I am not calculated to improve his retiring disposition; but I think he would miss me beyond the feeling of the moment if we were wholly separated.\n",

      "When I die in the Clapham Road, I shall not leave much more in this world than I shall take out of it; but, I happen to have a miniature of a bright-faced boy, with a curling head, and an open shirt-frill waving down his bosom (my mother had it taken for me, but I can't believe that it was ever like), which will be worth nothing to sell, and which I shall beg may he given to Frank. I have written my dear boy a little letter with it, in which I have told him that I felt very sorry to part from him, though bound to confess that I knew no reason why I should remain here. I have given him some short advice, the best in my power, to take warning of the consequences of being nobody's enemy but his own; and I have endeavoured to comfort him for what I fear he will consider a bereavement, by pointing out to him, that I was only a superfluous something to every one but him; and that having by some means failed to find a place in this great assembly, I am better out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such (said the poor relation, clearing his throat and beginning to speak a little louder) is the general impression about me. Now, it is a remarkable circumstance which forms the aim and purpose of my story, that this is all wrong. This is not my life, and these are not my habits. I do not even live in the Clapham Road. Comparatively speaking, I am very seldom there. I reside, mostly, in a--I am almost ashamed to say the word, it sounds so full of pretension--in a Castle. I do not mean that it is an old baronial habitation, but still it is a building always known to every one by the name of a Castle. In it, I preserve the particulars of my history; they run thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "It was when I first took John Spatter (who had been my clerk) into partnership, and when I was still a young man of not more than five- and-twenty, residing in the house of my uncle Chill, from whom I had considerable expectations, that I ventured to propose to Christiana. I had loved Christiana a long time. She was very beautiful, and very winning in all respects. I rather mistrusted her widowed mother, who I feared was of a plotting and mercenary turn of mind; but, I thought as well of her as I could, for Christiana's sake. I never had loved any one but Christiana, and she had been all the world, and far more than all the world, to me, from our childhood!\n",
      "\n",
      "Christiana accepted me with her mother's consent, and I was rendered very happy indeed. My life at my uncle Chill's was of a spare dull kind, and my garret chamber was as dull, and bare, and cold, as an upper prison room in some stern northern fortress. But, having Christiana's love, I wanted nothing upon earth. I would not have changed my lot with any human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avarice was, unhappily, my uncle Chill's master-vice. Though he was rich, he pinched, and scraped, and clutched, and lived miserably. As Christiana had no fortune, I was for some time a little fearful of confessing our engagement to him; but, at length I wrote him a letter, saying how it all truly was. I put it into his hand one night, on going to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I came down-stairs next morning, shivering in the cold December air; colder in my uncle's unwarmed house than in the street, where the winter sun did sometimes shine, and which was at all events enlivened by cheerful faces and voices passing along; I carried a heavy heart towards the long, low breakfast-room in which my uncle sat. It was a large room with a small fire, and there was a great bay window in it which the rain had marked in the night as if with the tears of houseless people. It stared upon a raw yard, with a cracked stone pavement, and some rusted iron railings half uprooted, whence an ugly out-building that had once been a dissecting-room (in the time of the great surgeon who had mortgaged the house to my uncle), stared at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We rose so early always, that at that time of the year we breakfasted by candle-light. When I went into the room, my uncle was so contracted by the cold, and so huddled together in his chair behind the one dim candle, that I did not see him until I was close to the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I held out my hand to him, he caught up his stick (being infirm, he always walked about the house with a stick), and made a blow at me, and said, \"You fool!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncle,\" I returned, \"I didn't expect you to be so angry as this.\" Nor had I expected it, though he was a hard and angry old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You didn't expect!\" said he; \"when did you ever expect? When did you ever calculate, or look forward, you contemptible dog?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are hard words, uncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hard words? Feathers, to pelt such an idiot as you with,\" said he. \"Here! Betsy Snap! Look at him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Betsy Snap was a withered, hard-favoured, yellow old woman--our only domestic--always employed, at this time of the morning, in rubbing my uncle's legs. As my uncle adjured her to look at me, he put his lean grip on the crown of her head, she kneeling beside him, and turned her face towards me. An involuntary thought connecting them both with the Dissecting Room, as it must often have been in the surgeon's time, passed across my mind in the midst of my anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look at the snivelling milksop!\" said my uncle. \"Look at the baby! This is the gentleman who, people say, is nobody's enemy but his own. This is the gentleman who can't say no. This is the gentleman who was making such large profits in his business that he must needs take a partner, t'other day. This is the gentleman who is going to marry a wife without a penny, and who falls into the hands of Jezabels who are speculating on my death!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew, now, how great my uncle's rage was; for nothing short of his being almost beside himself would have induced him to utter that concluding word, which he held in such repugnance that it was never spoken or hinted at before him on any account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On my death,\" he repeated, as if he were defying me by defying his own abhorrence of the word. \"On my death--death--Death! But I'll spoil the speculation. Eat your last under this roof, you feeble wretch, and may it choke you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You may suppose that I had not much appetite for the breakfast to which I was bidden in these terms; but, I took my accustomed seat. I saw that I was repudiated henceforth by my uncle; still I could bear that very well, possessing Christiana's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "He emptied his basin of bread and milk as usual, only that he took it on his knees with his chair turned away from the table where I sat. When he had done, he carefully snuffed out the candle; and the cold, slate-coloured, miserable day looked in upon us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Mr. Michael,\" said he, \"before we part, I should like to have a word with these ladies in your presence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you will, sir,\" I returned; \"but you deceive yourself, and wrong us, cruelly, if you suppose that there is any feeling at stake in this contract but pure, disinterested, faithful love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To this, he only replied, \"You lie!\" and not one other word.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went, through half-thawed snow and half-frozen rain, to the house where Christiana and her mother lived. My uncle knew them very well. They were sitting at their breakfast, and were surprised to see us at that hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your servant, ma'am,\" said my uncle to the mother. \"You divine the purpose of my visit, I dare say, ma'am. I understand there is a world of pure, disinterested, faithful love cooped up here. I am happy to bring it all it wants, to make it complete. I bring you your son-in-law, ma'am--and you, your husband, miss. The gentleman is a perfect stranger to me, but I wish him joy of his wise bargain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He snarled at me as he went out, and I never saw him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is altogether a mistake (continued the poor relation) to suppose that my dear Christiana, over-persuaded and influenced by her mother, married a rich man, the dirt from whose carriage wheels is often, in these changed times, thrown upon me as she rides by. No, no. She married me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way we came to be married rather sooner than we intended, was this. I took a frugal lodging and was saving and planning for her sake, when, one day, she spoke to me with great earnestness, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Michael, I have given you my heart. I have said that I loved you, and I have pledged myself to be your wife. I am as much yours through all changes of good and evil as if we had been married on the day when such words passed between us. I know you well, and know that if we should be separated and our union broken off, your whole life would be shadowed, and all that might, even now, be stronger in your character for the conflict with the world would then be weakened to the shadow of what it is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God help me, Christiana!\" said I. \"You speak the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Michael!\" said she, putting her hand in mine, in all maidenly devotion, \"let us keep apart no longer. It is but for me to say that I can live contented upon such means as you have, and I well know you are happy. I say so from my heart. Strive no more alone; let us strive together. My dear Michael, it is not right that I should keep secret from you what you do not suspect, but what distresses my whole life. My mother: without considering that what you have lost, you have lost for me, and on the assurance of my faith: sets her heart on riches, and urges another suit upon me, to my misery. I cannot bear this, for to bear it is to be untrue to you. I would rather share your struggles than look on. I want no better home than you can give me. I know that you will aspire and labour with a higher courage if I am wholly yours, and let it be so when you will!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was blest indeed, that day, and a new world opened to me. We were married in a very little while, and I took my wife to our happy home. That was the beginning of the residence I have spoken of; the Castle we have ever since inhabited together, dates from that time. All our children have been born in it. Our first child--now married--was a little girl, whom we called Christiana. Her son is so like Little Frank, that I hardly know which is which.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current impression as to my partner's dealings with me is also quite erroneous. He did not begin to treat me coldly, as a poor simpleton, when my uncle and I so fatally quarrelled; nor did he afterwards gradually possess himself of our business and edge me out. On the contrary, he behaved to me with the utmost good faith and honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matters between us took this turn:- On the day of my separation from my uncle, and even before the arrival at our counting-house of my trunks (which he sent after me, NOT carriage paid), I went down to our room of business, on our little wharf, overlooking the river; and there I told John Spatter what had happened. John did not say, in reply, that rich old relatives were palpable facts, and that love and sentiment were moonshine and fiction. He addressed me thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Michael,\" said John, \"we were at school together, and I generally had the knack of getting on better than you, and making a higher reputation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had, John,\" I returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Although\" said John, \"I borrowed your books and lost them; borrowed your pocket-money, and never repaid it; got you to buy my damaged knives at a higher price than I had given for them new; and to own to the windows that I had broken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All not worth mentioning, John Spatter,\" said I, \"but certainly true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you were first established in this infant business, which promises to thrive so well,\" pursued John, \"I came to you, in my search for almost any employment, and you made me your clerk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still not worth mentioning, my dear John Spatter,\" said I; \"still, equally true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And finding that I had a good head for business, and that I was really useful to the business, you did not like to retain me in that capacity, and thought it an act of justice soon to make me your partner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still less worth mentioning than any of those other little circumstances you have recalled, John Spatter,\" said I; \"for I was, and am, sensible of your merits and my deficiencies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, my good friend,\" said John, drawing my arm through his, as he had had a habit of doing at school; while two vessels outside the windows of our counting-house--which were shaped like the stern windows of a ship--went lightly down the river with the tide, as John and I might then be sailing away in company, and in trust and confidence, on our voyage of life; \"let there, under these friendly circumstances, be a right understanding between us. You are too easy, Michael. You are nobody's enemy but your own. If I were to give you that damaging character among our connexion, with a shrug, and a shake of the head, and a sigh; and if I were further to abuse the trust you place in me--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you never will abuse it at all, John,\" I observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never!\" said he; \"but I am putting a case--I say, and if I were further to abuse that trust by keeping this piece of our common affairs in the dark, and this other piece in the light, and again this other piece in the twilight, and so on, I should strengthen my strength, and weaken your weakness, day by day, until at last I found myself on the high road to fortune, and you left behind on some bare common, a hopeless number of miles out of the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly so,\" said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To prevent this, Michael,\" said John Spatter, \"or the remotest chance of this, there must be perfect openness between us. Nothing must be concealed, and we must have but one interest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear John Spatter,\" I assured him, \"that is precisely what I mean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And when you are too easy,\" pursued John, his face glowing with friendship, \"you must allow me to prevent that imperfection in your nature from being taken advantage of, by any one; you must not expect me to humour it--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear John Spatter,\" I interrupted, \"I DON'T expect you to humour it. I want to correct it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I, too,\" said John.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly so!\" cried I. \"We both have the same end in view; and, honourably seeking it, and fully trusting one another, and having but one interest, ours will be a prosperous and happy partnership.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure of it!\" returned John Spatter. And we shook hands most affectionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took John home to my Castle, and we had a very happy day. Our partnership throve well. My friend and partner supplied what I wanted, as I had foreseen that he would, and by improving both the business and myself, amply acknowledged any little rise in life to which I had helped him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not (said the poor relation, looking at the fire as he slowly rubbed his hands) very rich, for I never cared to be that; but I have enough, and am above all moderate wants and anxieties. My Castle is not a splendid place, but it is very comfortable, and it has a warm and cheerful air, and is quite a picture of Home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our eldest girl, who is very like her mother, married John Spatter's eldest son. Our two families are closely united in other ties of attachment. It is very pleasant of an evening, when we are all assembled together--which frequently happens--and when John and I talk over old times, and the one interest there has always been between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really do not know, in my Castle, what loneliness is. Some of our children or grandchildren are always about it, and the young voices of my descendants are delightful--O, how delightful!--to me to hear. My dearest and most devoted wife, ever faithful, ever loving, ever helpful and sustaining and consoling, is the priceless blessing of my house; from whom all its other blessings spring. We are rather a musical family, and when Christiana sees me, at any time, a little weary or depressed, she steals to the piano and sings a gentle air she used to sing when we were first betrothed. So weak a man am I, that I cannot bear to hear it from any other source. They played it once, at the Theatre, when I was there with Little Frank; and the child said wondering, \"Cousin Michael, whose hot tears are these that have fallen on my hand!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is my Castle, and such are the real particulars of my life therein preserved. I often take Little Frank home there. He is very welcome to my grandchildren, and they play together. At this time of the year--the Christmas and New Year time--I am seldom out of my Castle. For, the associations of the season seem to hold me there, and the precepts of the season seem to teach me that it is well to be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the Castle is--\" observed a grave, kind voice among the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. My Castle,\" said the poor relation, shaking his head as he still looked at the fire, \"is in the Air. John our esteemed host suggests its situation accurately. My Castle is in the Air! I have done. Will you be so good as to pass the story?\"\n",

      "The first of April came dark and stormy, with silver whips of lightning cracking open the lowering clouds that seemed to skim the treetops. My brother Tom and I, recovering from chest colds, tired of reading and listening to the radio, turned to the big living-room window of our house on Syringa Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here they come, Mother,\" cried Tom when a big truck drove up in the teeming rain and stopped in front of the empty cottage across the street. Mother hurried in from the kitchen and we three looked out. That truck, we knew, contained the Duvitch family and all their earthly possessions. Mr. Duvitch and the biggest boy carefully helped Mrs. Duvitch from the seat and walked her into the house, supporting her all the way. Another big boy, carrying a well-bundled baby, followed. A stream of young Duvitches, accompanied by a big brown houndlike dog, poured out of the back of the truck and stood in a huddle in the rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barnyard sounds we heard escaped from two crates of hens the Duvitches had fetched along and from a burlap bag in which a small flock of ducks had been stowed. While the livestock made noises according to its kind, the Duvitches were quiet--almost solemn. They showed no elation at finding themselves in a new neighborhood and a very pretty neighborhood at that.\n",
      "\n",
      "All afternoon Mother, Tom and myself had been watching out for them, with rather mixed emotions. For the Duvitches were immigrants and the first of their nationality to settle in our small smug town. Coming to our obscure part of the state a year before, they had moved into a rotting old farmhouse two miles north of town, long abandoned. After the slashing hurricane of mid-March, the moss-rotten dwelling looked like the house in the fairy tale that remained standing only because it did not know which way to fall and the Duvitches were forced to give it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if Mrs. Duvitch is ill,\" murmured Mother, looking through the rain at the dreary street scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She must be,\" said Tom. \"I wonder if it'll be all right for Andy and me to help 'em move in their stuff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This request, as Mother well knew, was not inspired by genuine feeling for the Duvitches but by curiosity and she shook her head. It was a strict family rule that any illness which kept us out of school would automatically keep us indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Duvitches got along very well without help from us. As it turned out, they were old hands at moving. For years before coming to America they had been on the move, to escape starvation, separation, possible assassination. Every child capable of two-legged locomotion pitched in and helped carry the things from the truck. In no time at all, it seemed, the truck was empty and the Duvitches were shut up tight in their new home.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the signal for Mother to step into the kitchen. She returned swathed in her hooded raincoat, carrying a basket containing a vacuum jug of chicken soup, a baked tuna fish dish, steaming hot; a loaf of fresh bread and a chocolate cake. These she took to the house across the street and gave basket and all to the boy who answered her knock. It wasn't her plan to stop for a visit that day but to wait a week or so and call when the Duvitches were all settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day when the three of us--Mother, Tom and myself--were having lunch, we heard a faint tap at the back door. I answered it and there stood a pale dark-eyed boy, looking very solemn, holding our basket. It contained the empty vacuum jug, casserole dish and cake plate, all of which shone, and a tiny very shapely potted rose tree, in exquisite pink-tipped bud, the handsomest plant--and the only plant of its kind--ever seen in that neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I send them a few scraps of food,\" murmured Mother, a few seconds later, deeply touched, \"and get this queenly gift!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was our last traffic with the Duvitch family for over two years. When Mother stopped to visit them a week after their coming, the little girl who opened the door a few inches said, \"Mamma sick; she stay in bed today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Duvitch never crossed the street to our house and Mother, a rather formal woman, made no further attempts to see the family. But Father disagreed when she remarked that she thought the Duvitches probably wished to be left alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syringa Street seemed to be a friendly street. It was a crooked maple-shady country lane that wound through the town without losing its charm. The sidewalk here and there was almost lost in weeds and the ditches, in places, were brightened by clumps of orange day lilies. Widely spaced cottages, some of them smothered in vines, only seemed to make the neighborhood more rural. There were brilliant flower gardens, vegetable plots, fruit trees--and a few henhouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children, who enjoyed all the benefits of country life while actually living in town, were quite numerous. Behind the facades of the street's dwellings there was probably no more greed, envy, superstition or intolerance than lurked behind the doors of any average dwelling in any average American town. The cardinal virtues, no doubt, were all represented. Yes, Syringa Street seemed to be a friendly street.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Duvitches were marked people. They were the one struggling family in a prosperous community--and poverty, amid prosperity, is often embarrassing and irritating to the prosperous. They were considered unattractive physically. They were so meek! The Duvitches never fought back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The women started in on Mrs. Duvitch because she \"never showed her face.\" It is true, she was rarely if ever seen in the daytime, emerging from her dwelling only after dark in warm weather, to sit on the veranda, where she found privacy behind the ragged trumpet creeper. But this gave rise to the rumor that she was the victim of an obscure skin disease and that every morning she shook scales out of the bed sheet. (When my father heard that one, he went out to the pantry and mixed himself a tall drink.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Duvitch, too, was classified as an untouchable. His job, a rather malodorous one, was with the local rendering plant as a laborer. It followed that the Syringa Street young, meeting him on the street, sometimes stopped their noses as they passed him by--a form of torment all the more acute when Mr. Duvitch had to share it with the children that happened to be with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Black hard luck seemed to be their lot. A few weeks after they moved to Syringa Street they suffered a tragedy they were all summer in recovering from--Mr. Duvitch lost two weeks' pay while gathering mushrooms in Tamarack Swamp. Inside of a year and a half, three Duvitch boys had lost, among them, by various mishaps, two fingers, one eye and an ear lobe. They were forever being cut up, bruised, mutilated by things falling, breaking, cracking and exploding.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mild case of typhoid, mass cases of whooping cough and measles--all plagued the family within a year of their arrival. Their only bright spot here was Dr. Switzer, one of the town's kindliest souls. He declined to accept fees, but was several times seen leaving the Duvitch cottage, carrying off a handsome house plant and looking very pleased. The Duvitches' dog, Kasimar, acted just like the family to which he belonged--like one of the world's poorest canine relations. He seemed to be afraid of his own shadow and no one had ever heard him bark or growl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because they cast their eyes on the sidewalk as one passed them by and spoke only when spoken to, the young Duvitches, like their parents, were considered antisocial. They were regarded as born scavengers too, for they spent hours foraging in the town dump, where they often picked up their footgear, some of their pants and shirts and furnishings for the house as well. They went on country excursions to gather watercress, dandelion greens, mushrooms and wild berries; and the few apples and tomatoes they occasionally concealed under their blouses didn't make the farmers on whom they poached much poorer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I raided tomato patches and robbed apple trees just for the fun of it. That first September four Duvitches--Irving, Benny, Abe and Esther--registered at the local grammar school. Mrs. Lovejoy, the principal, said they were bright, conscientious, pathetically eager but almost pathologically shy. Before she could put a stop to it, some of their classmates scoffed at the leaf, lard and black bread sandwiches they ate for lunch, huddled in one corner of the recreation room, dressed in their boiled-out ragpickers' clothes. After school they headed straight for home, never lingering on the playground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the tradesmen to whom the Duvitches gave good money were either curt with them or downright rude. Mrs. Frithjof Kinsella, the proprietor of the general store and a big jolly Viking who could be heard two blocks away, extended credit to almost everybody in town and had a way of insulting her customers so heartily that they all loved her for it. The Duvitches, however, Mrs. Kinsella very carefully did not insult (a form of insult in itself) and neither did she extend them credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mother, remembering the potted rose tree, always had a friendly word and a smile for the young Duvitches when she saw them and a bone for Kasimar when he found courage to venture across the road. Father was the only man on Syringa Street who tipped his hat to sixteen-year-old Maria Duvitch, when he met her coming home from her piece-work job in Miller's Box Factory. It may have been that their European travail made it easy for them to endure such a trifle as humiliation in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think,\" said Father one fine Saturday morning in July two years after the Duvitches had come to Syringa Street, \"that it would be very pleasant for Andy, Tom and myself to pitch our tent out at Durston's Pond and spend the night. We could fish and swim. That is,\" he added, \"if Mother can spare us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can spare you very well,\" Mother said cheerfully. She had a notion it did menfolk good to get away occasionally and in this instance the sacrifice came easily, because camp life was little to her liking.\n",
      "\n",
      "She packed a hamper of food, Tom and I fetched a tent from the attic and Father looked over his fishing tackle. An hour after lunch we were driving through rolling farm country out to Durston's Pond, four miles north of town.\n",
      "\n",
      "We often had the serene little lake all to ourselves but on our arrival that afternoon we found half a dozen male Duvitches in possession. They had been fishing for several hours, casting from the shore, dropping their lines over the wooden bridge that spanned Cat Creek where it flowed into the pond and trolling for bass from a flat-bottomed rowboat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I, Philistines like our friends, ignored the Duvitch boys but Father went up to Mr. Duvitch, who was fishing from the shore, and put out his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon, Mr. Duvitch! It's nice to see you and the boys here. What a beautiful day! Are Mrs. Duvitch and the girls all well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Duvitch was a little fellow, a lean starveling of a man with watery blue eyes and a kicked-about look. Gratitude for being agreeably noticed showed in his mosquito-bitten face as he took Father's hand and his tremulous smile showed broken teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know the mosquitoes are biting,\" Father went on pleasantly, \"but are the fish?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Proudly, oh, so proudly, Mr. Duvitch exhibited the catch that would probably feed his family for the better part of a week: a fine mess of bass, perch and sunfish, all of them alive, as far as I could see, and swimming around in the oaken washtub in which they had been dropped. Father gave Mr. Duvitch hearty congratulations and said we couldn't hope to do as well but that we'd try.\n",
      "\n",
      "We three pitched the tent on a little knoll over the pond, and then Father, with a happy sigh, lay down on the blanket for a nap in the sun. Tom and I played a game of chew-the-peg on the grassy bank above the water and, later on, made several trips to the tent, for the camera, the field glasses, the sun lotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a trip for a cold drink from the vacuum jug and to fetch towels and soap, we stopped to look again at the Duvitches' catch of fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Duvitch and the boys had moved away and were fishing in a small arm of the pond below us. None of them seemed visible. Tom and I, our glances meeting over the big cake of soap in my hand, were similarly and wickedly inspired--the thing was irresistible. We held a brief whispering conversation; and then, egged on by him and quite willing on my own, I played a shameful trick on the Duvitches, the memory of which will come back to the end of my days to plague me. Without considering further, I dropped the cake of soap into the tub of fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's go,\" whispered Tom after we had watched the soap sink to the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "We swam out to the raft, diving and frolicking in the deep water. After a while the Duvitches, calling it a day, assembled at a spot on the shore below our tent, happy in the knowledge of a good catch to take home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a little while Tom and I could hear their muffled exclamations of disbelief and dismay. Father woke up and joined our neighbors in a conclave, looking down at the tub of fish near his feet. After a few moments he produced the whistle he carried on all our country excursions and blew it piercingly three times, the proclamation of emergency. This meant that Tom and I must come at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking as guilty as we felt, we swam in and joined the group gathering around the tub. In the midst of our stricken neighbors stood Father, holding the half-melted cake of soap in his palm silently but accusingly, for the fish had perished miserably in the soapy water and were unfit to eat. Not only had Tom and I snatched precious food from their mouths but we had brazenly advertised the contempt in which we held them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father's eyes were narrow slits of blue fire in his white face. I had never seen him so angry. One look at Tom and me told him everything. Words would have been superfluous and my brother and I bowed our heads in acknowledgment of our guilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will begin,\" Father said in a voice I didn't recognize, \"by saying you're sorry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Our stunned neighbor wiped his blinking eyes as he listened to our mumbled words, which Father made us repeat when they were inaudible. But there was no hostility, no animosity toward us in the man and it was obvious also that he considered himself too humble to receive an apology, finding it, like most of life's troubles, a mockery to be endured without protest. His sons showed no resentment, either, only a kind of resignation in their minds, which carried almost atavistic memories of century-old oppression by country barons and landed gentry.\n",
      "\n",
      "One-eyed Manny Duvitch, as it turned out, had told Father he had seen me drop something in the tub of fish (before he learned that it had been a cake of soap). Now he looked guiltier than Tom and I. Because he had been the witness and accuser, it was as if he considered himself to be the troublemaker, deserving the punishment. The two real culprits were the young lords of the ruling manor, with unlimited license, exempt from chastisement. To Manny, the fortunate, the well-to-do, were also the privileged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you realize,\" said Father coldly, looking from Tom to me, \"that in certain primitive communities the sort of stunt you've pulled would be punishable by death?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I did not reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Turn over the tub,\" said Father abruptly, addressing us as if we were strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We turned it over. The gray soapy water ran away in bubbly rivulets, disappearing in the coarse mat of turf, and the poisoned fish lay exposed on the grass--quiet, strangled, open-mouthed--and somehow looking as if they were mutely protesting their horrid unnatural fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count the fish,\" Father ordered us, his voice like steel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I got down on our knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How many are there?\" demanded Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sixty-one,\" I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How many bass?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twelve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Father handed Mr. Duvitch two dollars, the price of a day's rental of the r owboat. Then, looking both the avenging angel and executioner, he ordered Tom and me, with our tackle and bait, off the land we had disgraced--into exile, out on Durston's Pond.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you are not to come back,\" he gave out in the same steely tones, \"until you've caught sixty-one fish to repay Mr. Duvitch. See to it that among them you bring in at least a dozen bass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Father stepped up to the tent on the knoll to fetch our shirts and dungarees. These he rolled into a tight ball and shot like a bolt into the rowboat. He then turned his back to us and, thus disowned, Tom and I lost no time in rowing out on the pond. Father's decisions, even with Mother present, were never reversed and swift execution, from which there was no appeal, followed his sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out in the middle of the big pond we dropped anchor, threaded our steel rods and, baiting our hooks, began to fish. I knew that if it took us all summer to catch them, we dared not set foot ashore without sixty-one fish. Almost at once Tom pulled in a good- sized bass and ten minutes later two yellow perch were added to our string. The crestfallen Duvitches went home. Father threw himself on the blanket, furiously smoking a cigar. That was about four in the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, the mosquitoes! They were bad enough at the time, and while the light held, but after we had been fishing for three hours and had caught eight fish, they swarmed out of the swampland surrounding the pond in legions. After an hour of it we wanted to leap overboard. They got in our ears, our noses, our eyes, even in our mouths, and nestling in our hair, they bit through to our scalps. I remembered tales of Indian prisoners in Alaska, turned loose on the tundra by their captors, where they died of the mosquitoes in two hours. Several times we slipped over the side of the boat, immersing ourselves in the water to escape the bloodthirsty clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night dragged on while the whining swarms grew thicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Andy, what time is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ten o'clock, Tom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" Tom groaned and pulled in another bass and killed six or eight mosquitoes in one slap. Two hours passed and midnight was ghostly on Durston's Pond. The moon, bright as day, sailed high in the purple sky, dimming the starfire, casting a great white shaft of quivering radiance on the water, but it was all hideous. The big yellow disk sank in a gauzy cloudbank, then disappeared for good and the stars shone out with renewed splendor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Andy, what time is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two o'clock, Tom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The treetops whispered as if in conspiracy against us. Owls hooted--mockingly we thought--and bats circled over our heads, making us feel thoroughly alone. Our only solace was the campfire Father kept burning near the tent, which flared like a beacon of light in the dark. We went on fishing as our tormentors bit and sang. Each hour was an eternity of frenzy and I fairly panted for the light of dawn to come, but even now I cannot decide which was worse, that night with the mosquitoes on Durston's Pond or the following day in the blistering heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Andy--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's four o'clock, Tom, and we've got sixteen fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dawn came but even I, a highly impressionable youngster of seventeen, did not enjoy that calm effulgent majesty of daybreak. A long stretch on Durston's Pond, under the July sun, still faced us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rising sun was red, casting glimmering circles of rose-colored light on the windless surface of the pond. The mosquitoes thinned, the fish continued to bite. But as we fished the sun mounted steadily and by eleven it had fulfilled its awful prophecy and became a ball of fire in the cloudless skies. Tom and I began to bake in the heat waves that shimmered over the pond and we were steamed in the scalding vapory mist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was night again, Andy,\" groaned Tom after sweating out two hours of it. \"This is worse than the mosquitoes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At least we won't get any infections from our bites, Tom,\" I said feebly. \"The sun's cauterizing them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We might get sunstrokes, though. We're liable to, without our hats. But I don't care if I do. I'd rather be unconscious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was only fifteen and I think he hated me that day. I, the older, should have been his protector against participation in crime, not his accomplice. I wanted to row him in, then come back to finish the business alone, but there on the green Eden-like shore stood Father, stationed there barring the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I weighed our hooks down to the deep cold water. We caught two more bass and half a dozen sunfish.\n",
      "\n",
      "By one o'clock groups of people gathered on the shore, for word of the drama that was being enacted on Durston's Pond had spread through the town. Some of the visitors praised Father for his stern discipline; others berated him. He went right on reading his magazine and smoking his cigar, as indifferent to their praise as he was to their criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local fishermen who knew the lake and something about the angling ability of the average youngster made gloomy estimates as to the possible length of our exile on the water. A few had us fishing until the snow flew. They made bets too. Would Tom and I have the guts to stick it out? Most of the bets were against us.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we sat there in the rowboat, without food, through the hottest day of the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "No breeze stirred. No cloud obscured the sun. Even the bird life of the swamp, usually a medley of song, was silent and dead. Tom was drooping visibly in the glare and I tried hard not to look at his scorched face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between three and four we dropped lines in a school of yellow perch and pulled up no less than twenty. The bass continued to bite in the deep black holes off the swamp, which bristled with tree trunks. Benumbed, half-blinded, moving like automatons, Tom and I geared ourselves for the home stretch.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun, dropping low, had lost its fury and the hard blue enamel of the sky began to pale, I pulled up the thirteenth bass, which was our sixty first fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turned lobster-red, fairly devoured, famished and drooping from lack of sleep, we put together our rods and with our remaining strength rowed to where Father was waiting. He received us coolly, making no comment on our condition. At once he asked to see the fish and we held them up by the strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count them,\" he said. Obviously we would receive permission to land only when we had produced the required number, which was the price of our freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sixty-one,\" said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Including thirteen bass,\" I added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good,\" said Father in businesslike tones. \"We will now restore to Mr. Duvitch his rightful property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I took care not to play the part of triumphant heroes, even of redeemed sinners--that would not have suited our parent. Certainly, in appearance, we were more condemned than redeemed. But when we tottered out of the rowboat something in me was quietly rejoicing. I guessed that Father was secretly proud of our fortitude and I realized, too, that all through the night he had suffered with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked through the crowd of visitors on the lake shore, climbed into the car and silently drove to the Duvitch cottage. Mrs. Duvitch and the children were not visible but we found Mr. Duvitch sitting on the porch.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw Tom and me and we silently handed him the strings of fish, he gulped and swallowed hard. For a moment he could not speak. Then, in a voice that was raw with emotion, he protested that he had not wished us to suffer so. Suppose we had fallen overboard in the dark?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you shake hands with the boys?\" asked Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Mr. Duvitch broke down. My brother and I did not know where to look and during those moments we suffered more acutely than we had suffered in the clouds of mosquitoes and under the broiling sun. After our neighbor had composed himself, he seized our hands and bowed his head over them. There was something Biblical in the man's gesture. Anyway, it was my greatest lesson in humility.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mother, who had heard about our exile on the pond from a neighbor, saw us she burst into tears. She tried to embrace us but we drew back painfully. While she was rubbing salves and ointments on our seared backs and necks, somebody knocked at the kitchen door and Father opened it to find Mrs. Duvitch standing there--the first time she had crossed the street to our house.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her pale swaying hand Mrs. Duvitch held a porcelain teacup, ornamented with pink rosebuds and golden leaves--a relic from the old country and, as it turned out, her most cherished possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her voice, thin and wispy from fright and shock, was difficult to follow. But we gathered that she had brought the teacup over as a peace offering and as a plea for our forgiveness to her family for the living purgatory, no matter whose fault, through which my brother and I had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mother declined the teacup and assured Mrs. Duvitch that she would not have it otherwise with Tom and me, our neighbor, unable to find her tongue, made a little eloquent sign with her hands that was for thanks and that looked like a silent blessing. She quietly turned and went away; and again I felt that I had witnessed a profound moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother continued her ministrations to Tom and me and put us to bed. Despite our skin, which stuck to sheet and pillowcase, we slept like creatures drugged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is high time,\" Tom and I heard Father say calmly, sanely, to Mother around noon next day when we woke up, \"for this senseless feeling against the Duvitches to stop and I'm willing to do still more to stop it. Tonight we are having supper with them. I've just seen Mr. Duvitch and he remarked that since Andy and Tom caught the fish, he'd feel better if we all shared in them. I suggested a fish-fry picnic supper and with a few hints from me, and some encouragement, he invited us over. It may be an ordeal but we ought to be able to bear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked across the street at six o'clock, not knowing what to expect. All the Duvitches, dressed in their Sunday best, bright and flushed and shining as we had never seen them, received us at the door as if we had been royalty. They looked at Tom and me and delicately looked away--I shuddered when I thought of what my brother and I would have had to endure had this been any other family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of a wretched abode we found a scantily furnished home that shone with cleanliness and smelled of spicy garden pinks. In its almost barren simplicity there was something comely. A few of the stands, chairs and tables had the intimate quality of what is fashioned by the human hand. These, together with odds and ends the family had brought from the old country and others resurrected from the town dump and mended, painted, waxed and polished, made for a kind of native household harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house plants (no window was without several) delighted Mother. Mrs. Duvitch was raising little orange and lemon trees from seed and experimenting with a pineapple plant growing in a butter tub.\n",
      "\n",
      "At once we were conscious of a remarkable difference in the demeanor of the family. The children, thrilled by their first party, by the family's first recognition in this country, kept showing their pleasure in wide delighted smiles. I couldn't believe they were the same timid downcast youngsters one met on the street and saw in school; they seemed to have been touched by a wand. The Duvitches' home was their castle: sustained and animated by the security of its four walls, shut away from a world of contempt and hostility, they were complete human beings. In their own house their true personalities emerged.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the host Mr. Duvitch was a man we were seeing for the first time. Overjoyed to have neighbors in his house, he was so full of himself that I was conscious of an invisible stature in him which made him seem quite as tall as Father. He beamed and feasted his eyes on us. Saying very little, he managed to make us feel a great deal and he constantly sought his wife's eyes with glances of delight over the wonder of what was happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "David, the oldest boy, helped his father serve a bottle of homemade blackberry wine. We ate fried fish and good food of the American picnic variety at a long plank table set out in the back yard under an apple tree. The young Duvitches passed things politely, never helping themselves first, and their thanks upon receiving a dish were almost ceremonial. They waited patiently for their plates and ate every scrap of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father kept the conversation going. His every word was listened to, every childish eye riveted on him while he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I, fascinated by the family's metamorphosis, almost forgot about our blisters and our stings. As father told stories and jokes, we discovered that the Duvitches had a gift for gaiety, for laughter, all but extinguished but still capable of resurrection. They were merry people who had suffered too much. How strange to see the boys and girls throw back their heads and laugh when Father said something that was funny, but not terribly funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper we were ushered to the open summer kitchen, the coolest room in the house, for entertainment. David played folk songs on his accordion. Mr. Duvitch turned out to be an amateur ventriloquist; he made the dog Kasimar talk Polish, the cat Jan talk Russian and a doll named Sophia, talk English. Mrs. Duvitch read aloud to us, translating as she went along, a letter her mother had received from the great actress Modjeska, whom her family had known long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could tell that the Duvitches were a great revelation to Father and that he had enjoyed the evening tremendously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To think,\" he murmured as if talking to himself, while we were crossing the street, \"that they should turn out to be gentle people of cultivation and accomplishment. Looked down on and ignored by their inferiors!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I like to believe that the oil paintings of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, which hung in our living room, helped to establish the Duvitches in our community. Even the fountain tinkling in the lily pool in our garden might have helped. In that town, oil paintings and flowing fountains were the symbols of wealth and aristocracy. Only a few mansions on Sycamore Hill were adorned with such.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because our home was graced with these symbols, we had always been classified with the town's great, which gave us such prestige in the neighborhood that people often followed our lead. Obviously the Duvitches were important in Father's eyes, shown by the rigorous sentence he had imposed on Tom and me for our misuse of them. Added to that, we had recognized the family by taking a meal with them in their own house.\n",
      "\n",
      "People, often persuaded to accept what we accepted, to believe what we believed, began to think the Duvitches must really count, after all. Most of our neighbors decided that if they were good enough for a highly educated man like Father (the only college graduate on Syringa Street), they were good enough for them. The galvanized community began to look upon things in a different light and it soon became the fashion to give the Duvitches the favorable nod.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother invited Mrs. Duvitch to a tea party, where her delicate manners, and the fine needlework which engaged her, won the approval of the local housewives who were present. On hot days our neighbor asked one of her big boys to carry the pineapple plant (which Mother had advertised well) into the back yard; and since botanical rarities were irresistible in that town of gardens, people were soon stopping by the fence for a look at the tropical specimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Mrs. Duvitch found courage to ask these people into her house and, if Mr. Duvitch was at home, he told the visitors stories about life in the old country. It was then that the neighborhood learned about the family's European past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children ceased stopping their noses when Mr. Duvitch passed them by and it wasn't long before the young Duvitches were able to enjoy outside companionship when they found time to play. They blossomed out in school and they were soon shining in school plays and festivals. Even Kasimar began to take on the ways of an American dog, daring to bark and growl on occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nathan Duvitch, who was seventeen, could throw and hit a baseball as far as anybody his age in town. When I learned this, and let it be known, he was asked to join one of the local ball clubs. David, invited to play his accordion at a country dance, turned out to be a magician with the instrument and ended up being one of the community's most popular players. Mrs. Frithjof Kinsella gave One-eyed Manny an after-school job in her store and later on told Mother he was worth three boys put together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The community presently had reason to be grateful for Mrs. Duvitch's presence. It turned out that she had a great gift for nursing, and no fear of death, no fear of disease, contagious or otherwise. In times of severe illness Dr. Switzer often suggested that she be sent for--her own girls could take over at home. There were almost no nurses in town and the nearest hospital was over a hundred miles away. When Mrs. Duvitch quietly slipped into a sickroom, she never failed to bring along a sedative influence, a kind of sanity. After an hour or two of her serene presence, the patient was calmed and comforted and the family reassured.\n",
      "\n",
      "People began to turn to the Duvitches in all kinds of trouble. A boy who got in a bad scrape, a bitter family quarrel, a baby who had come into the world deformed--the elder Duvitches, with their old-world wisdom and gift for accepting the inevitable, could sit by the hour and argue gently and convincingly against disgrace, false pride, grief, fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most surprising of all, Mr. Duvitch, in one respect, turned out to be characteristically American. One Saturday afternoon when my ball team was playing Nathan's, Father met him in the local ball park.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chust like de American boy,\" Mr. Duvitch exploded when Nathan made a timely hit that drove in two runs. Our neighbor choked with pride and went on: \"Nathan's battering averich three hunnert tventy-sevened!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOn a cold snowy afternoon in winter Mr. Duvitch stopped at our house and presented Father (who had enormous hands, much bigger than any of the Duvitches') with a handsome pair of leather mittens, lined with fur, which had a slightly acrid ashy odor. \"No doubt one of the boys resurrected them from a heap of ashes in the dump,\" remarked Father, drawing on the mittens, which fitted perfectly. \"Why should I value them any the less? Who would have dreamed that the Duvitches would have so much more to offer us than we have to offer them?\"\n",

      "Peter Morton woke with a start to face the first light. Rain tapped against the glass. It was January the fifth.\n",
      "He looked across a table on which a night-light had guttered into a pool of water, at the other bed. Francis Morton was still asleep, and Peter lay down again with his eyes on his brother.  It amused him to imagine it was himself whom he watched, the same hair, the same eyes, the same lips and line of cheek. But the thought palled, and the mind went back to the fact which lent the day importance. It was the fifth of January.  He could hardly believe a year had passed since Mrs Henne-Falcon had given her last children's party.\n",
      "Francis turned suddenly upon his back and threw an arm across his face, blocking his mouth. Peter's heart began to beat fast, not with pleasure now but with uneasiness. He sat up and called across the table, \"Wake up.\" Francis's shoulders shook and he waved a clenched fist in the air, but his eyes remained closed. To Peter Morton the whole room seemed to darken, and he had the impression of a great bird swooping. He cried again, \"Wake up,\" and once more there was silver light and the touch of rain on the windows.\n",
      "Francis rubbed his eyes. \"Did you call out?\"' he asked.\n",
      "\"You are having a bad dream,\" Peter said.  Already experience had taught him how far their minds reflected each other. But he was the elder, by a matter of minutes, and that brief extra interval of light, while his brother still struggled in pain and darkness, had given him self-reliance and an instinct of protection towards the other who was  afraid of so many things.\n",
      "\"I dreamed that I was dead,\" Francis said.\n",
      "\"What was it like?\"' Peter asked.\n",
      "\"I can't remember,\" Francis said.\n",
      "\"You dreamed of a big bird.\"\n",
      "\"Did I?\"\n",
      "The two lay silent in bed facing each other, the same green eyes, the same nose tilting at the tip, the same firm lips, and the same premature modelling of the chin. The fifth of January, Peter thought again, his mind drifting idly from the image of cakes to the prizes which might be won. Egg-and-spoon races, spearing apples in basins of water, blind man's buff.\n",
      "\"I don't want to go,\" Francis said  suddenly. \"I suppose Joyce will be there Â",
      " Mabel Warren.\" Hateful to him, the thought of a party shared with those two. They were older than he. Joyce was eleven and Mabel Warren thirteen. The long pigtails swung superciliously to a masculine stride. Their sex humiliated him, as they watched him fumble with his egg, from under lowered scornful lids. And last year Â",
      " he turned his face away from Peter, his cheeks scarlet.\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\"' Peter asked.\n",
      "\"Oh, nothing. I don't think I'm well. I've got a cold. I oughtn't to go to the party.\"\n",
      "Peter was puzzled. \"But Francis,  is it a bad cold?\"\n",
      "\"It will be a bad cold if I go to the party.  Perhaps I shall die.\"\n",
      "\"Then you mustn't go,\" Peter said, prepared  to solve all difficulties with one plain sentence, and Francis let his nerves relax, ready to leave everything to Peter. But though he was grateful he did not turn his face towards his brother. His cheeks still bore the badge of a shameful memory, of the game of hide and seek last year in the darkened house, and of how he had screamed when Mabel Warren put her hand suddenly upon his arm. He had not heard her coming. Girls were like that. Their shoes never squeaked. No boards whined under the tread. They slunk like cats on padded claws.\n",
      "When the nurse came in with hot water Francis lay tranquil leaving everything to Peter. Peter said, \"Nurse, Francis has got a cold.\"\n",
      "The tall starched woman laid the towels across the cans and said, without turning, \"The washing won't be back till tomorrow. You must lend him some of your handkerchiefs.\"\n",
      "\"But, Nurse,\" Peter asked, \"hadn't he better stay in bed?\"\n",
      "\"We'll take him for a good walk this morning,\" the nurse said. \"Wind'll blow away the germs. Get up now, both of you,\" and she closed the door behind her.\n",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Peter said. \"Why don't you just stay in bed? I'll tell mother you felt too ill to get up.\" But rebellion against destiny was not in Francis's power. If he stayed in bed they would come up and tap his chest and put a thermometer in his mouth and look at his tongue, and they would discover he was malingering. It was true he felt ill, a sick empty sensation in his stomach and a rapidly beating heart, but he knew the cause was only fear, fear of the party, fear of being made to hide by himself in the dark, uncompanioned by Peter and with no night-light to make a blessed breach.\n",
      "\"No, I'll get up,\" he said, and then with sudden desperation, \"But I won't go to Mrs Henne-Falcon's party. I swear on the Bible I won't.\" Now surely all would be well, he thought. God would not allow him to break so solemn an oath. He would show him a way. There was all the morning before him and all the afternoon until four o'clock. No need to worry when the grass was still crisp with the early frost. Anything might happen. He might cut himself or break his leg or really catch a bad cold. God would manage somehow.\n",
      "He had such confidence in God that when at breakfast his mother said, \"I hear you have a cold, Francis,\" he made light of it. \"We should have heard more about it,\" his mother said with irony, \"if there was not a party this evening,\" and Francis smiled, amazed and daunted by her ignorance of him.\n",
      "His happiness would have lasted longer if, out for a walk that morning, he had not met Joyce. He was alone with his nurse, for Peter had leave to finish a rabbit-hutch in the woodshed. If Peter had been there he would have cared less; the nurse was Peter's nurse also, but now it was as though she were employed only for his sake, because he could not be trusted to go for a walk alone. Joyce was only two years older and she was by herself.\n",
      "She came striding towards them, pigtails flapping. She glanced scornfully at Francis and spoke with ostentation to the nurse. \"Hello, Nurse. Are you bringing Francis to the party this evening? Mabel and I are coming.\" And she was off again down the street in the direction of Mabel Warren's home, consciously alone and self-sufficient in the long empty road.\n",
      "\"Such a nice girl,\" the nurse said. But Francis was silent, feeling again the jump-jump of his heart, realizing how soon the hour of the party would arrive. God had done nothing for him, and the minutes flew.\n",
      "They flew too quickly to plan any evasion, or even to prepare his heart for the coming ordeal. Panic nearly overcame him when, all unready, he found himself standing on the doorstep, with coat-collar turned up against a cold wind, and the nurse's electric torch making a short trail through the darkness. Behind him were the lights of the hall and the sound of a servant laying the table for dinner, which his mother and father would eat alone. He was nearly overcome by the desire to run back into the house and call out to his mother that he would not go to the party, that he dared not go. They could not make him go. He could almost hear himself saying those final words, breaking down for ever the barrier of ignorance which saved his mind from his parents' knowledge. \"I'm afraid of going. I won't go. I daren't go. They'll  make me hide in the dark, and I'm afraid of the dark. I'll scream and scream and scream.\"\n",
      "He could see the expression of amazement on his mother's face, and then the cold confidence of a grown-up's retort. \"Don't be silly. You must go. We've accepted Mrs Henne-Falcon's invitation.\"\n",
      "But they couldn't make him go; hesitating on the doorstep while the nurse's feet crunched across the frost-covered grass to the gate, he knew that. He would answer: \"You can say I'm ill. I won't go. I'm afraid of the dark.\" And his mother: \"Don't be silly. You know there's nothing to be afraid of in the dark.\" But he knew the falsity of that reasoning; he knew how they taught also that there was nothing to fear in death, and how fearfully they avoided the idea of it. But they couldn't make him go to the party. \"I'll scream. I'll scream.\"\n",
      "\"Francis, come along.\" He heard the nurse's voice across the dimly phosphorescent lawn and saw the yellow circle of her torch wheel from tree to shrub. \"I'm coming,\" he called with despair; he couldn't bring himself to lay bare his last secrets and end reserve between his mother and himself, for there was still in the last resort a further appeal possible to Mrs Henne-Falcon. He comforted himself with that, as he advanced steadily across the hall, very small, towards her enormous bulk. His heart beat unevenly, but he had control now over his voice, as he said with meticulous accent, \"Good evening,  Mrs Henne-Falcon. It was very good of you to ask me to your party.\" With his strained face lifted towards the curve of her breasts, and his polite set speech, he was like an old withered man. As a twin he was in many ways an only child. To address Peter was to speak to his own image in a mirror, an image a little altered by a flaw in the glass, so as to throw back less a likeness of what he was than of what he wished to be, what he would be without his unreasoning fear of darkness, footsteps of strangers, the flight of bats in dusk-filled gardens.\n",
      "\"Sweet child,\" said Mrs Henne-Falcon absent-mindedly, before, with a wave of her arms, as though the children were a flock of chickens, she whirled them into her set programme of entertainments: egg-and-spoon races, three-legged races, the spearing of apples, games which held for Francis nothing worse than humiliation. And in the frequent intervals when nothing was required of him and he could stand alone in corners as far removed as possible from Mabel Warren's scornful gaze, he was able to plan how he might avoid the approaching terror of the dark. He knew there was nothing to fear until after tea, and not until he was sitting down in a pool of yellow radiance cast by the ten candles on Colin Henne-Falcon's birthday cake did he become fully conscious of the imminence of what he feared. He heard Joyce's high voice down the table, \"After tea we are going to play hide and seek in the dark.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" Peter said, watching Francis's troubled face, \"don't let's. We play that every year.\"\n",
      "\"But it's in the programme,\" cried Mabel Warren. \"I saw it myself. I looked over Mrs Henne-Falcon's shoulder. Five o'clock tea. A quarter to six to half past, hide and seek in the dark. It's all written down in the programme.\"\n",
      "Peter did not argue, for if hide and seek had been inserted in Mrs Henne-Falcon's programme, nothing which he could say would avert it. He asked for another piece of birthday cake and sipped his tea slowly. Perhaps it might be possible to delay the game for a quarter of an hour, allow Francis at least a few extra minutes to form a plan, but even in that Peter failed, for children were already leaving the table in twos and threes. It was his third failure, and again he saw a great bird darken his brother's face with its wings. But he upbraided himself silently for his folly, and finished his cake encouraged by the memory of that adult refrain, \"There's nothing to fear in the dark.\" The last to leave the table, the brothers came together to the hall to meet the mustering and impatient eyes of Mrs Henne-Falcon.\n",
      "\"And now,\" she said, \"we will play hide and seek in the dark.\"\n",
      "Peter watched his brother and saw the lips tighten. Francis, he knew, had feared this moment from the beginning of the party, had tried to meet it with courage and had abandoned the attempt. He must have prayed for cunning to evade the game, which was now welcomed with cries of excitement by all the other children. \"Oh, do let's.\" \"We must pick  sides.\" \"Is any of the house out of bounds?\"'  \"Where shall home be?\"'\n",
      "\"I think,\" said Francis Morton, approaching Mrs Henne-Falcon, his eyes focused unwaveringly on her exuberant breasts, \"it will be no use my playing. My nurse will be calling for me very soon.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, but your nurse can wait, Francis,\" said Mrs Henne-Falcon, while she clapped her hands together to summon to her side a few children who were\n",
      "\n",
      "already straying up the wide staircase to upper floors. \"Your mother will never mind.\"\n",
      "That had been the limit of Francis's cunning. He had refused to believe that so well-prepared an excuse could fail. All that he could say now, still in the precise tone which other children hated, thinking it a symbol of conceit, was, \"I think I had better not play.\" He stood motionless, retaining, though afraid, unmoved features. But the knowledge of his terror, or the reflection of the terror itself, reached his brother's brain. For the moment, Peter Morton could have cried aloud with the fear of bright lights going out, leaving him alone in an island of dark surrounded by the gentle lappings of strange footsteps. Then he remembered that the fear was not his own, but his brother's. He said impulsively to Mrs Henne-Falcon, \"Please, I don't think Francis should play. The dark makes him jump so.\" They were the wrong words. Six children began to sing, \"Cowardy cowardy custard,\" turning torturing faces with the vacancy of wide sunflowers towards Francis Morton.\n",
      "Without looking at his brother, Francis said, \"Of course I'll play. I'm not afraid, I only thought Â",
      "\" But he was already forgotten by his human tormentors. The children scrambled round Mrs Henne-Falcon, their shrill voices pecking at her with questions and suggestions.\n",
      "\"Yes, anywhere in the house. We will turn out all the lights. Yes, you can hide in the cupboards. You must stay hidden as long as you can. There will be no home.\"\n",
      "Peter stood apart, ashamed of the clumsy manner in which he had tried to help his brother.  Now he could feel, creeping in at the corners of  his brain, all Francis's resentment of his championing. Several children ran upstairs, and the lights on the top floor went out. Darkness came down like the wings of a bat and settled on the landing. Others began to put out the lights at the edge of the hall, till the children were all gathered in the central radiance of the chandelier, while the bats squatted round on hooded wings and waited for that, too, to be extinguished.\n",
      "\"You and Francis are on the hiding side,\" a tall girl said, and then the light was gone, and the carpet wavered under his feet with the sibilance of footfalls, like small cold draughts, creeping away into corners.\n",
      "\"Where's Francis?\"' he wondered. \"If I join him he'll be less frightened of all these sounds.\" \"These sounds\" were the casing of silence: the squeak of a loose board, the cautious closing of a cupboard door, the whine of a finger drawn along polished wood.\n",
      "Peter stood in the centre of the dark deserted floor, not listening but waiting for the idea of his brother's whereabouts to enter his brain. But Francis crouched with fingers on his ears, eyes uselessly closed, mind numbed against impressions, and only a sense of strain could cross the gap of dark. Then a voice called \"Coming\", and as though his brother's self-possession had been shattered by the sudden cry, Peter Morton jumped with his fear.  But it was not his own fear. What in his brother was a burning panic was in him an altruistic emotion that left the reason unimpaired. \"Where, if I were Francis, should I hide?\"' And because he was, if not Francis himself, at least a mirror to him, the answer was immediate. \"Between the oak bookcase on the left of the study door, and the leather settee.\" Between the twins there could be no jargon of telepathy. They had been together in the womb, and they could not be parted.\n",
      "Peter Morton tiptoed towards Francis's hiding-place. Occasionally a board rattled, and because he feared to be caught by one of the  soft questers through the dark, he bent and untied his laces. A tag struck the floor and the metallic sound set a host of cautious feet moving in his direction. But by that time he was in his stockings and would have laughed inwardly at the pursuit had not the noise of someone stumbling on his abandoned shoes made his heart trip. No more boards revealed Peter Morton's progress.\n",
      "On stockinged feet he moved silently and  unerringly towards his object. Instinct told him he was near the wall, and, extending a hand, he laid the fingers across his brother's face.\n",
      "Francis did not cry out, but the leap of his own heart revealed to Peter a proportion of Francis's terror. \"It's all right,\" he whispered, feeling down the squatting figure until he captured a clenched hand. \"It's only me. I'll stay with you.\" And grasping the other tightly, he listened to the cascade of whispers his utterance had caused to fall. A hand touched the book-case close to Peter's head and he was aware of how Francis's fear continued in spite of his presence. It was less intense, more  bearable, he hoped, but it remained. He knew that it was his brother's fear and not his own that he experienced. The dark to him was only an absence of  light; the groping hand that of a familiar child. Patiently he waited to be found.\n",
      "He did not speak again, for between Francis and himself was the most intimate communion. By way of joined hands thought could flow more swiftly than lips could shape themselves round words. He could experience the whole progress of his brother's emotion, from the leap of panic at the unexpected contact to the steady pulse of fear, which now went on and on with the regularity of a heart-beat. Peter Morton thought with intensity, \"I am here. You needn't be afraid. The lights will go on again soon. That rustle, that movement is nothing to fear. Only Joyce, only Mabel Warren.\" He bombarded the drooping form with thoughts of safety, but he was conscious that the fear continued. \"They are beginning to whisper together. They are tired of looking for us. The lights will go on soon. We shall have won. Don't be afraid. That was someone on the stairs. I believe it's Mrs Henne-Falcon. Listen. They are feeling for the lights.\" Feet moving on a carpet, hands  brushing a wall, a curtain pulled apart, a clicking handle, the opening of a cupboard door.  In the case above their heads a loose book shifted under a touch. \"Only Joyce, only Mabel Warren, only Mrs Henne-Falcon,\" a crescendo of reassuring thought before the chandelier burst, like a fruit-tree, into bloom.\n",
      "The voice of the children rose shrilly into the radiance. \"Where's Peter?\"' \"Have you looked upstairs?\"' \"Where's Francis?\"' but they were silenced again by Mrs Henne-Falcon's scream. But she was not the first to notice Francis Morton's stillness, where he had collapsed against the wall at the touch of his brother's hand.  Peter continued to hold the clenched fingers in an arid and puzzled grief. It was not merely that his  brother was dead. His brain, too young to realize the full paradox, wondered with an obscure self-pity why it was that the pulse of his brother's fear went on and on, when Francis was now where he had always been told there was no more terror and no more--darkness.\n",

      "\t\t\tHow Santa Claus Came to Simpson's Bar\n",
      "\t\t\n",

      "\n",
      "It had been raining in the valley of the Sacramento. The North Fork had overflowed its banks and Rattlesnake Creek was impassable. The few boulders that had marked the summer ford at Simpson's Crossing were obliterated by a vast sheet of water stretching to the foothills. The up stage was stopped at Grangers; the last mail had been abandoned in the tules, the rider swimming for his life. \"An area,\" remarked the \"Sierra Avalanche,\" with pensive local pride, \"as large as the State of Massachusetts is now under water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was the weather any better in the foothills. The mud lay deep on the mountain road; wagons that neither physical force nor moral objurgation could move from the evil ways into which they had fallen, encumbered the track, and the way to Simpson's Bar was indicated by broken-down teams and hard swearing. And farther on, cut off and inaccessible, rained upon and bedraggled, smitten by high winds and threatened by high water, Simpson's Bar, on the eve of Christmas day, 1862, clung like a swallow's nest to the rocky entablature and splintered capitals of Table Mountain, and shook in the blast.\n",
      "\n",
      "As night shut down on the settlement, a few lights gleamed through the mist from the windows of cabins on either side of the highway now crossed and gullied by lawless streams and swept by marauding winds. Happily most of the population were gathered at Thompson's store, clustered around a red-hot stove, at which they silently spat in some accepted sense of social communion that perhaps rendered conversation unnecessary. Indeed, most methods of diversion had long since been exhausted on Simpson's Bar; high water had suspended the regular occupations on gulch and on river, and a consequent lack of money and whiskey had taken the zest from most illegitimate recreation. Even Mr. Hamlin was fain to leave the Bar with fifty dollars in his pocket -- the only amount actually realized of the large sums won by him in the successful exercise of his arduous profession. \"Ef I was asked,\" he remarked somewhat later, --\"ef I was asked to pint out a purty little village where a retired sport as didn't care for money could exercise hisself, frequent and lively, I'd say Simpson's Bar; but for a young man with a large family depending on his exertions, it don't pay.\" As Mr. Hamlin's family consisted mainly of female adults, this remark is quoted rather to show the breadth of his humor than the exact extent of his responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Howbeit, the unconscious objects of this satire sat that evening in the listless apathy begotten of idleness and lack of excitement. Even the sudden splashing of hoofs before the door did not arouse them. Dick Bullen alone paused in the act of scraping out his pipe, and lifted his head, but no other one of the group indicated any interest in, or recognition of, the man who entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a figure familiar enough to the company, and known in Simpson's Bar as \"The Old Man.\" A man of perhaps fifty years; grizzled and scant of hair, but still fresh and youthful of complexion. A face full of ready, but not very powerful sympathy, with a chameleon-like aptitude for taking on the shade and color of contiguous moods and feelings. He had evidently just left some hilarious companions, and did not at first notice the gravity of the group, but clapped the shoulder of the nearest man jocularly, and threw himself into a vacant chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jest heard the best thing out, boys! Ye know Smiley, over yar -- Jim Smiley - - funniest man in the Bar? Well, Jim was jest telling the richest yarn about - -\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Smiley's a ---- fool,\" interrupted a gloomy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A particular ---- skunk,\" added another in sepulchral accents.\n",
      "\n",
      "A silence followed these positive statements. The Old Man glanced quickly around the group. Then his face slowly changed. \"That's so,\" he said reflectively, after a pause, \"certingly a sort of a skunk and suthin of a fool. In course.\" He was silent for a moment as in painful contemplation of the unsavoriness and folly of the unpopular Smiley. \"Dismal weather, ain't it?\" he added, now fully embarked on the current of prevailing sentiment. \"Mighty rough papers on the boys, and no show for money this season. And tomorrow's Christmas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a movement among the men at this announcement, but whether of satisfaction or disgust was not plain. \"Yes,\" continued the Old Man in the lugubrious tone he had, within the last few moments, unconsciously adopted, -- \"yes, Christmas, and tonight's Christmas eve. Ye see, boys, I kinder thought -- that is, I sorter had an idee, jest passin' like, you know -- that may be ye'd all like to come over to my house tonight and have a sort of tear round. But I suppose, now, you wouldn't? Don't feel like it, may be?\" he added with anxious sympathy, peering into the faces of his companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know,\" responded Tom Flynn with some cheerfulness. \"P'r'aps we may. But how about your wife, Old Man? What does SHE say to it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Man hesitated. His conjugal experience had not been a happy one, and the fact was known to Simpson's Bar. His first wife, a delicate, pretty little woman, had suffered keenly and secretly from the jealous suspicions of her husband, until one day he invited the whole Bar to his house to expose her infidelity. On arriving, the party found the shy, petite creature quietly engaged in her household duties, and retired abashed and discomfited. But the sensitive woman did not easily recover from the shock of this extraordinary outrage. It was with difficulty she regained her equanimity sufficiently to release her lover from the closet in which he was concealed and escape with him. She left a boy of three years to comfort her bereaved husband. The Old Man's present wife had been his cook. She was large, loyal, and aggressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he could reply, Joe Dimmick suggested with great directness that it was the \"Old Man's house,\" and that, invoking the Divine Power, if the case were his own, he would invite whom he pleased, even if in so doing he imperilled his salvation. The Powers of Evil, he further remarked, should contend against him vainly. All this delivered with a terseness and vigor lost in this necessary translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In course. Certainly. Thet's it,\" said the Old Man with a sympathetic frown. \"Thar's no trouble about THET. It's my own house, built every stick on it myself. Don't you be afeard o' her, boys. She MAY cut up a trifle rough -- ez wimmin do -- but she'll come round.\" Secretly the Old Man trusted to the exaltation of liquor and the power of courageous example to sustain him in such an emergency.\n",

      "As yet, Dick Bullen, the oracle and leader of Simpson's Bar, had not spoken. He now took his pipe from his lips. \"Old Man, how's that yer Johnny gettin' on? Seems to me he didn't look so peart last time I seed him on the bluff heavin' rocks at Chinamen. Didn't seem to take much interest in it. Thar was a gang of 'em by yar yesterday -- drownded out up the river -- and I kinder thought o' Johnny, and how he'd miss 'em! May be now, we'd be in the way ef he wus sick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The father, evidently touched not only by this pathetic picture of Johnny's deprivation, but by the considerate delicacy of the speaker, hastened to assure him that Johnny was better and that a \"little fun might 'liven him up.\" Whereupon Dick arose, shook himself, and saying, \"I'm ready. Lead the way, Old Man: here goes,\" himself led the way with a leap, a characteristic howl, and darted out into the night. As he passed through the outer room he caught up a blazing brand from the hearth. The action was repeated by the rest of the party, closely following and elbowing each other, and before the astonished proprietor of Thompson's grocery was aware of the intention of his guests, the room was deserted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was pitchy dark. In the first gust of wind their temporary torches were extinguished, and only the red brands dancing and flitting in the gloom like drunken will-o'-the-wisps indicated their whereabouts. Their way led up Pine-Tree Canyon, at the head of which a broad, low, bark-thatched cabin burrowed in the mountain-side. It was the home of the Old Man, and the entrance to the tunnel in which he worked when he worked at all. Here the crowd paused for a moment, out of delicate deference to their host, who came up panting in the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"P'r'aps ye'd better hold on a second out yer, whilst I go in and see thet things is all right,\" said the Old Man, with an indifference he was far from feeling. The suggestion was graciously accepted, the door opened and closed on the host, and the crowd, leaning their backs against the wall and cowering under the eaves, waited and listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a few moments there was no sound but the dripping of water from the eaves, and the stir and rustle of wrestling boughs above them. Then the men became uneasy, and whispered suggestion and suspicion passed from the one to the other. \"Reckon she's caved in his head the first lick!\" \"Decoyed him inter the tunnel and barred him up, likely.\" \"Got him down and sittin' on him.\" \"Prob'ly bilin suthin to heave on us: stand clear the door, boys!\" For just then the latch clicked, the door slowly opened, and a voice said, \"Come in out o' the wet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice was neither that of the Old Man nor of his wife. It was the voice of a small boy, its weak treble broken by that preternatural hoarseness which only vagabondage and the habit of premature self-assertion can give. It was the face of a small boy that looked up at theirs -- a face that might have been pretty and even refined but that it was darkened by evil knowledge from within, and dirt and hard experience from without. He had a blanket around his shoulders and had evidently just risen from his bed. \"Come in,\" he repeated,\" and don't make no noise. The Old Man's in there talking to mar,\" he continued, pointing to an adjacent room which seemed to be a kitchen, from which the Old Man's voice came in deprecating accents. \"Let me be,\" he added, querulously, to Dick Bullen, who had caught him up, blanket and all, and was affecting to toss him into the fire, \"let go o' me, you d----d old fool, d'ye hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus adjured, Dick Bullen lowered Johnny to the ground with a smothered laugh, while the men, entering quietly, ranged themselves around a long table of rough boards which occupied the centre of the room. Johnny then gravely proceeded to a cupboard and brought out several articles which he deposited on the table. \"Thar's whiskey. And crackers. And red herons. And cheese.\" He took a bite of the latter on his way to the table. \"And sugar.\" He scooped up a mouthful en route with a small and very dirty hand. \"And terbacker. Thar's dried appils too on the shelf, but I don't admire 'em. Appils is swellin'. Thar,\" he concluded, \"now wade in, and don't be afeard. I don't mind the old woman. She don't b'long to ME. S'long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had stepped to the threshold of a small room, scarcely larger than a closet, partitioned off from the main apartment, and holding in its dim recess a small bed. He stood there a moment looking at the company, his bare feet peeping from the blanket, and nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Johnny! You ain't goin' to turn in agin, are ye?\" said Dick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I are,\" responded Johnny, decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, wot's up, old fellow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How sick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got a fevier. And childblains. And roomatiz,\" returned Johnny, and vanished within. After a moment's pause, he added in the dark, apparently from under the bedclothes, --\"And biles!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an embarrassing silence. The men looked at each other, and at the fire. Even with the appetizing banquet before them, it seemed as if they might again fall into the despondency of Thompson's grocery, when the voice of the Old Man, incautiously lifted, came deprecatingly from the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly! Thet's so. In course they is. A gang o' lazy drunken loafers, and that ar Dick Bullen's the ornariest of all. Didn't hev no more sabe than to come round yar with sickness in the house and no provision. Thet's what I said: 'Bullen,' sez I, 'it's crazy drunk you are, or a fool,' sez I, 'to think o' such a thing.' 'Staples,' I sez, 'be you a man, Staples, and 'spect to raise h-ll under my roof and invalids lyin' round?' But they would come -- they would. Thet's wot you must 'spect o' such trash as lays round the Bar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A burst of laughter from the men followed this unfortunate exposure. Whether it was overheard in the kitchen, or whether the Old Man's irate companion had just then exhausted all other modes of expressing her contemptuous indignation, I cannot say, but a back door was suddenly slammed with great violence. A moment later and the Old Man reappeared, haply unconscious of the cause of the late hilarious outburst, and smiled blandly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The old woman thought she'd jest run over to Mrs. McFadden's for a sociable call,\" he explained, with jaunty indifference, as he took a seat at the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oddly enough it needed this untoward incident to relieve the embarrassment that was beginning to be felt by the party, and their natural audacity returned with their host. I do not propose to record the convivialities of that evening. The inquisitive reader will accept the statement that the conversation was characterized by the same intellectual exaltation, the same cautious reverence, the same fastidious delicacy, the same rhetorical precision, and the same logical and coherent discourse somewhat later in the evening, which distinguish similar gatherings of the masculine sex in more civilized localities and under more favorable auspices. No glasses were broken in the absence of any; no liquor was uselessly spilt on floor or table in the scarcity of that article.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nearly midnight when the festivities were interrupted. \"Hush,\" said Dick Bullen, holding up his hand. It was the querulous voice of Johnny from his adjacent closet: \"O dad!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Man arose hurriedly and disappeared in the closet. Presently he reappeared. \"His rheumatiz is coming on agin bad,\" he explained, \"and he wants rubbin'.\" He lifted the demijohn of whiskey from the table and shook it. It was empty. Dick Bullen put down his tin cup with an embarrassed laugh. So did the others. The Old Man examined their contents and said hopefully, \"I reckon that's enough; he don't need much. You hold on all o' you for a spell, and I'll be back\"; and vanished in the closet with an old flannel shirt and the whiskey. The door closed but imperfectly, and the following dialogue was distinctly audible: --\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Sonny, whar does she ache worst?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes over yar and sometimes under yer; but it's most powerful from yer to yer. Rub yer, dad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A silence seemed to indicate a brisk rubbing. Then Johnny:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hevin' a good time out yer, dad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sonny.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tomorrer's Chrismiss, ain't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Sonny. How does she feel now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Better rub a little furder down. Wot's Chrismiss, anyway? Wot's it all about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O, it's a day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This exhaustive definition was apparently satisfactory, for there was a silent interval of rubbing. Presently Johnny again:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mar sez that everywhere else but yer everybody gives things to everybody Chrismiss, and then she jist waded inter you. She sez thar's a man they call Sandy Claws, not a white man, you know, but a kind o' Chinemin, comes down the chimbley night afore Chrismiss and gives things to chillern -- boys like me. Puts 'em in their butes! Thet's what she tried to play upon me. Easy now, pop, whar are you rubbin' to -- thet's a mile from the place. She jest made that up, didn't she, jest to aggrewate me and you? Don't rub thar . . . Why, dad!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the great quiet that seemed to have fallen upon the house the sigh of the near pines and the drip of leaves without was very distinct. Johnny's voice, too, was lowered as he went on, \"Don't you take on now, fur I'm gettin' all right fast. Wot's the boys doin' out thar?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Man partly opened the door and peered through. His guests were sitting there sociably enough, and there were a few silver coins and a lean buckskin purse on the table. \"Bettin' on suthin -- some little game or 'nother. They're all right,\" he replied to Johnny, and recommenced his rubbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd like to take a hand and win some money,\" said Johnny, reflectively, after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Man glibly repeated what was evidently a familiar formula, that if Johnny would wait until he struck it rich in the tunnel he'd have lots of money, etc., etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Johnny, \"but you don't. And whether you strike it or I win it, it's about the same. It's all luck. But it's mighty cur'o's about Chrismiss -- ain't it? Why do they call it Chrismiss?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps from some instinctive deference to the overhearing of his guests, or from some vague sense of incongruity, the Old Man's reply was so low as to be inaudible beyond the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Johnny, with some slight abatement of interest, \"I've heerd o' HIM before. Thar, that'll do, dad. I don't ache near so bad as I did. Now wrap me tight in this yer blanket. So. Now,\" he added in a muffled whisper, \"sit down yer by me till I go asleep.\" To assure himself of obedience, he disengaged one hand from the blanket and, grasping his father's sleeve, again composed himself to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some moments the Old Man waited patiently. Then the unwonted stillness of the house excited his curiosity, and without moving from the bed, he cautiously opened the door with his disengaged hand, and looked into the main room. To his infinite surprise it was dark and deserted. But even then a smouldering log on the hearth broke, and by the upspringing blaze he saw the figure of Dick Bullen sitting by the dying embers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick started, rose, and came somewhat unsteadily toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whar's the boys?\" said the Old Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gone up the canyon on a little pasear. They're coming back for me in a minit. I'm waitin' round for 'em. What are you starin' at, Old Man?\" he added with a forced laugh; \"do you think I'm drunk?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Man might have been pardoned the supposition, for Dick's eyes were humid and his face flushed. He loitered and lounged back to the chimney, yawned, shook himself, buttoned up his coat and laughed. \"Liquor ain't so plenty as that, Old Man. Now don't you git up,\" he continued, as the Old Man made a movement to release his sleeve from Johnny's hand. \"Don't you mind manners. Sit jest whar you be; I'm goin' in a jiffy. Thar, that's them now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a low tap at the door. Dick Bullen opened it quickly, nodded \"Good night\" to his host, and disappeared. The Old Man would have followed him but for the hand that still unconsciously grasped his sleeve. He could have easily disengaged it: it was small, weak, and emaciated. But perhaps because it WAS small, weak, and emaciated, he changed his mind, and, drawing his chair closer to the bed, rested his head upon it. In this defenceless attitude the potency of his earlier potations surprised him. The room flickered and faded before his eyes, reappeared, faded again, went out, and left him -- asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime Dick Bullen, closing the door, confronted his companions. \"Are you ready?\" said Staples. \"Ready,\" said Dick; \"what's the time?\" \"Past twelve,\" was the reply; \"can you make it? -- it's nigh on fifty miles, the round trip hither and yon.\" \"I reckon,\" returned Dick, shortly. \"Whar's the mare?\" \"Bill and Jack's holdin' her at the crossin'.\" \"Let 'em hold on a minit longer,\" said Dick.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned and re-entered the house softly. By the light of the guttering candle and dying fire he saw that the door of the little room was open. He stepped toward it on tiptoe and looked in. The Old Man had fallen back in his chair, snoring, his helpless feet thrust out in a line with his collapsed shoulders, and his hat pulled over his eyes. Beside him, on a narrow wooden bedstead, lay Johnny, muffled tightly in a blanket that hid all save a strip of forehead and a few curls damp with perspiration. Dick Bullen made a step forward, hesitated, and glanced over his shoulder into the deserted room. Everything was quiet. With a sudden resolution he parted his huge mustaches with both hands and stooped over the sleeping boy. But even as he did so a mischievous blast, lying in wait, swooped down the chimney, rekindled the hearth, and lit up the room with a shameless glow from which Dick fled in bashful terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "His companions were already waiting for him at the crossing. Two of them were struggling in the darkness with some strange misshapen bulk, which as Dick came nearer took the semblance of a great yellow horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the mare. She was not a pretty picture. From her Roman nose to her rising haunches, from her arched spine hidden by the stiff machillas of a Mexican saddle, to her thick, straight, bony legs, there was not a line of equine grace. In her half-blind but wholly vicious white eyes, in her protruding under lip, in her monstrous color, there was nothing but ugliness and vice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now then,\" said Staples, \"stand cl'ar of her heels, boys, and up with you. Don't miss your first holt of her mane, and mind ye get your off stirrup QUICK. Ready!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a leap, a scrambling struggle, a bound, a wild retreat of the crowd, a circle of flying hoofs, two springless leaps that jarred the earth, a rapid play and jingle of spurs, a plunge, and then the voice of Dick somewhere in the darkness, \"All right!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't take the lower road back onless you're hard pushed for time! Don't hold her in down hill! We'll be at the ford at five. G'lang! Hoopa! Mula! GO!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A splash, a spark struck from the ledge in the road, a clatter in the rocky cut beyond, and Dick was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sing, O Muse, the ride of Richard Bullen! Sing, O Muse of chivalrous men! the sacred quest, the doughty deeds, the battery of low churls, the fearsome ride and grewsome perils of the Flower of Simpson's Bar! Alack! she is dainty, this Muse! She will have none of this bucking brute and swaggering, ragged rider, and I must fain follow him in prose, afoot!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one o'clock, and yet he had only gained Rattlesnake Hill. For in that time Jovita had rehearsed to him all her imperfections and practised all her vices. Thrice had she stumbled. Twice had she thrown up her Roman nose in a straight line with the reins, and, resisting bit and spur, struck out madly across country. Twice had she reared, and, rearing, fallen backward; and twice had the agile Dick, unharmed, regained his seat before she found her vicious legs again. And a mile beyond them, at the foot of a long hill, was Rattlesnake Creek. Dick knew that here was the crucial test of his ability to perform his enterprise, set his teeth grimly, put his knees well into her flanks, and changed his defensive tactics to brisk aggression. Bullied and maddened, Jovita began the descent of the hill. Here the artful Richard pretended to hold her in with ostentatious objurgation and well- feigned cries of alarm. It is unnecessary to add that Jovita instantly ran away. Nor need I state the time made in the descent; it is written in the chronicles of Simpson's Bar. Enough that in another moment, as it seemed to Dick, she was splashing on the overflowed banks of Rattlesnake Creek. As Dick expected, the momentum she had acquired carried her beyond the point of balking, and, holding her well together for a mighty leap, they dashed into the middle of the swiftly flowing current. A few moments of kicking, wading, and swimming, and Dick drew a long breath on the opposite bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "The road from Rattlesnake Creek to Red Mountain was tolerably level. Either the plunge in Rattlesnake Creek had dampened her baleful fire, or the art which led to it had shown her the superior wickedness of her rider, for Jovita no longer wasted her surplus energy in wanton conceits. Once she bucked, but it was from force of habit; once she shied, but it was from a new freshly painted meeting- house at the crossing of the county road. Hollows, ditches, gravelly deposits, patches of freshly springing grasses, flew from beneath her rattling hoofs. She began to smell unpleasantly, once or twice she coughed slightly, but there was no abatement of her strength or speed. By two o'clock he had passed Red Mountain and begun the descent to the plain. Ten minutes later the driver of the fast Pioneer coach was overtaken and passed by a \"man on a Pinto hoss,\" -- an event sufficiently notable for remark. At half past two Dick rose in his stirrups with a great shout. Stars were glittering through the rifted clouds, and beyond him, out of the plain, rose two spires, a flagstaff, and a straggling line of black objects. Dick jingled his spurs and swung his riata, Jovita bounded forward, and in another moment they swept into Tuttleville and drew up before the wooden piazza of \"The Hotel of All Nations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What transpired that night at Tuttleville is not strictly a part of this record. Briefly I may state, however, that after Jovita had been handed over to a sleepy ostler, whom she at once kicked into unpleasant consciousness, Dick sallied out with the bar-keeper for a tour of the sleeping town. Lights still gleamed from a few saloons and gambling-houses; but, avoiding these, they stopped before several closed shops, and by persistent tapping and judicious outcry roused the proprietors from their beds, and made them unbar the doors of their magazines and expose their wares. Sometimes they were met by curses, but oftener by interest and some concern in their needs, and the interview was invariably concluded by a drink. It was three o'clock before this pleasantry was given over, and with a small waterproof bag of india-rubber strapped on his shoulders Dick returned to the hotel. But here he was waylaid by Beauty -- Beauty opulent in charms, affluent in dress, persuasive in speech, and Spanish in accent! In vain she repeated the invitation in \"Excelsior,\" happily scorned by all Alpine- climbing youth, and rejected by this child of the Sierras -- a rejection softened in this instance by a laugh and his last gold coin. And then he sprang to the saddle and dashed down the lonely street and out into the lonelier plain, where presently the lights, the black line of houses, the spires, and the flagstaff sank into the earth behind him again and were lost in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storm had cleared away, the air was brisk and cold, the outlines of adjacent landmarks were distinct, but it was half past four before Dick reached the meeting-house and the crossing of the county road. To avoid the rising grade he had taken a longer and more circuitous road, in whose viscid mud Jovita sank fetlock deep at every bound. It was a poor preparation for a steady ascent of five miles more; but Jovita, gathering her legs under her, took it with her usual blind, unreasoning fury, and a half-hour later reached the long level that led to Rattlesnake Creek. Another half-hour would bring him to the creek. He threw the reins lightly upon the neck of the mare, chirruped to her, and began to sing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Jovita shied with a bound that would have unseated a less practised rider. Hanging to her rein was a figure that had leaped from the bank, and at the same time from the road before her arose a shadowy horse and rider. \"Throw up your hands,\" commanded this second apparition, with an oath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick felt the mare tremble, quiver, and apparently sink under him. He knew what it meant and was prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand aside, Jack Simpson, I know you, you d----d thief. Let me pass or --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not finish the sentence. Jovita rose straight in the air with a terrific bound, throwing the figure from her bit with a single shake of her vicious head, and charged with deadly malevolence down on the impediment before her. An oath, a pistol- shot, horse and highwayman rolled over in the road, and the next moment Jovita was a hundred yards away. But the good right arm of her rider, shattered by a bullet, dropped helplessly at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without slacking his speed he shifted the reins to his left hand. But a few moments later he was obliged to halt and tighten the saddle-girths that had slipped in the onset. This in his crippled condition took some time. He had no fear of pursuit, but looking up he saw that the eastern stars were already paling, and that the distant peaks had lost their ghostly whiteness, and now stood out blackly against a lighter sky. Day was upon him. Then completely absorbed in a single idea, he forgot the pain of his wound, and mounting again dashed on toward Rattlesnake Creek. But now Jovita's breath came broken by gasps, Dick reeled in his saddle, and brighter and brighter grew the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ride, Richard; run, Jovita; linger, O day!\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last few rods there was a roaring in his ears. Was it exhaustion from loss of blood, or what? He was dazed and giddy as he swept down the hill, and did not recognize his surroundings. Had he taken the wrong road, or was this Rattlesnake Creek?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was. But the brawling creek he had swam a few hours before had risen, more than doubled its volume, and now rolled a swift and resistless river between him and Rattlesnake Hill. For the first time that night Richard's heart sank within him. The river, the mountain, the quickening east, swam before his eyes. He shut them to recover his self-control. In that brief interval, by some fantastic mental process, the little room at Simpson's Bar and the figures of the sleeping father and son rose upon him. He opened his eyes wildly, cast off his coat, pistol, boots, and saddle, bound his precious pack tightly to his shoulders, grasped the bare flanks of Jovita with his bared knees, and with a shout dashed into the yellow water. A cry rose from the opposite bank as the head of a man and horse struggled for a few moments against the battling current, and then were swept away amidst uprooted trees and whirling drift-wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Man started and woke. The fire on the hearth was dead, the candle in the outer room flickering in its socket, and somebody was rapping at the door. He opened it, but fell back with a cry before the dripping half-naked figure that reeled against the doorpost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush! Is he awake yet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No -- but, Dick? --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dry up, you old fool! Get me some whiskey QUICK!\" The Old Man flew and returned with -- an empty bottle! Dick would have sworn, but his strength was not equal to the occasion. He staggered, caught at the handle of the door, and motioned to the Old Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thar's suthin' in my pack yer for Johnny. Take it off. I can't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Man unstrapped the pack and laid it before the exhausted man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Open it, quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did so with trembling fingers. It contained only a few poor toys -- cheap and barbaric enough, goodness knows, but bright with paint and tinsel. One of them was broken; another, I fear, was irretrievably ruined by water; and on the third -- ah me! there was a cruel spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It don't look like much, that's a fact,\" said Dick, ruefully . . . \"But it's the best we could do . . . Take 'em, Old Man, and put 'em in his stocking, and tell him -- tell him, you know -- hold me, Old Man --\" The Old Man caught at his sinking figure. \"Tell him,\" said Dick, with a weak little laugh -- \"tell him Sandy Claus has come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\tAnd even so, bedraggled, ragged, unshaven and unshorn, with one arm hanging helplessly at his side, Santa Claus came to Simpson's Bar and fell fainting on the first threshold. The Christmas dawn came slowly after, touching the remoter peaks with the rosy warmth of ineffable love. And it looked so tenderly on Simpson's Bar that the whole mountain as if caught in a generous action, blushed to the skies.\n",

      "There was commotion in Roaring Camp. It could not have been a fight, for in 1850 that was not novel enough to have called together the entire settlement. The ditches and claims were not only deserted, but \"Tuttle's grocery\" had contributed its gamblers, who, it will be remembered, calmly continued their game the day that French Pete and Kanaka Joe shot each other to death over the bar in the front room. The whole camp was collected before a rude cabin on the outer edge of the clearing. Conversation was carried on in a low tone, but the name of a woman was frequently repeated. It was a name familiar enough in the camp,--\"Cherokee Sal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\tPerhaps the less said of her the better. She was a coarse and, it is to be feared, a very sinful woman. But at that time she was the only woman in Roaring Camp, and was just then lying in sore extremity, when she most needed the ministration of her own sex. Dissolute, abandoned, and irreclaimable, she was yet suffering a martyrdom hard enough to bear even when veiled by sympathizing womanhood, but now terrible in her loneliness. The primal curse had come to her in that original isolation which must have made the punishment of the first transgression so dreadful. It was, perhaps, part of the expiation of her sin that, at a moment when she most lacked her sex's intuitive tenderness and care, she met only the half-contemptuous faces of her masculine associates. Yet a few of the spectators were, I think, touched by her sufferings. Sandy Tipton thought it was \"rough on Sal,\" and, in the contemplation of her condition, for a moment rose superior to the fact that he had an ace and two bowers in his sleeve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be seen also that the situation was novel. Deaths were by no means uncommon in Roaring Camp, but a birth was a new thing. People had been dismissed the camp effectively, finally, and with no possibility of return; but this was the first time that anybody had been introduced AB INITIO. Hence the excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You go in there, Stumpy,\" said a prominent citizen known as \"Kentuck,\" addressing one of the loungers. \"Go in there, and see what you kin do. You've had experience in them things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps there was a fitness in the selection. Stumpy, in other climes, had been the putative head of two families; in fact, it was owing to some legal informality in these proceedings that Roaring Camp--a city of refuge--was indebted to his company. The crowd approved the choice, and Stumpy was wise enough to bow to the majority. The door closed on the extempore surgeon and midwife, and Roaring Camp sat down outside, smoked its pipe, and awaited the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assemblage numbered about a hundred men. One or two of these were actual fugitives from justice, some were criminal, and all were reckless. Physically they exhibited no indication of their past lives and character. The greatest scamp had a Raphael face, with a profusion of blonde hair; Oakhurst, a gambler, had the melancholy air and intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet; the coolest and most courageous man was scarcely over five feet in height, with a soft voice and an embarrassed, timid manner. The term \"roughs\" applied to them was a distinction rather than a definition. Perhaps in the minor details of fingers, toes, ears, etc., the camp may have been deficient, but these slight omissions did not detract from their aggregate force. The strongest man had but three fingers on his right hand; the best shot had but one eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the physical aspect of the men that were dispersed around the cabin. The camp lay in a triangular valley between two hills and a river. The only outlet was a steep trail over the summit of a hill that faced the cabin, now illuminated by the rising moon. The suffering woman might have seen it from the rude bunk whereon she lay,--seen it winding like a silver thread until it was lost in the stars above.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fire of withered pine boughs added sociability to the gathering. By degrees the natural levity of Roaring Camp returned. Bets were freely offered and taken regarding the result. Three to five that \"Sal would get through with it;\" even that the child would survive; side bets as to the sex and complexion of the coming stranger. In the midst of an excited discussion an exclamation came from those nearest the door, and the camp stopped to listen. Above the swaying and moaning of the pines, the swift rush of the river, and the crackling of the fire rose a sharp, querulous cry,--a cry unlike anything heard before in the camp. The pines stopped moaning, the river ceased to rush, and the fire to crackle. It seemed as if Nature had stopped to listen too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camp rose to its feet as one man! It was proposed to explode a barrel of gunpowder; but in consideration of the situation of the mother, better counsels prevailed, and only a few revolvers were discharged; for whether owing to the rude surgery of the camp, or some other reason, Cherokee Sal was sinking fast. Within an hour she had climbed, as it were, that rugged road that led to the stars, and so passed out of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame, forever. I do not think that the announcement disturbed them much, except in speculation as to the fate of the child. \"Can he live now?\" was asked of Stumpy. The answer was doubtful. The only other being of Cherokee Sal's sex and maternal condition in the settlement was an ass. There was some conjecture as to fitness, but the experiment was tried. It was less problematical than the ancient treatment of Romulus and Remus, and apparently as successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "When these details were completed, which exhausted another hour, the door was opened, and the anxious crowd of men, who had already formed themselves into a queue, entered in single file. Beside the low bunk or shelf, on which the figure of the mother was starkly outlined below the blankets, stood a pine table. On this a candle- box was placed, and within it, swathed in staring red flannel, lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp. Beside the candle-box was placed a hat. Its use was soon indicated. \"Gentlemen,\" said Stumpy, with a singular mixture of authority and EX OFFICIO complacency,-- \"gentlemen will please pass in at the front door, round the table, and out at the back door. Them as wishes to contribute anything toward the orphan will find a hat handy.\" The first man entered with his hat on; he uncovered, however, as he looked about him, and so unconsciously set an example to the next. In such communities good and bad actions are catching. As the procession filed in comments were audible,--criticisms addressed perhaps rather to Stumpy in the character of showman; \"Is that him?\" \"Mighty small specimen;\" \"Has n't more 'n got the color;\" \"Ain't bigger nor a derringer.\" The contributions were as characteristic: A silver tobacco box; a doubloon; a navy revolver, silver mounted; a gold specimen; a very beautifully embroidered lady's handkerchief (from Oakhurst the gambler); a diamond breastpin; a diamond ring (suggested by the pin, with the remark from the giver that he \"saw that pin and went two diamonds better\"); a slung-shot; a Bible (contributor not detected); a golden spur; a silver teaspoon (the initials, I regret to say, were not the giver's); a pair of surgeon's shears; a lancet; a Bank of England note for 5 pounds; and about $200 in loose gold and silver coin. During these proceedings Stumpy maintained a silence as impassive as the dead on his left, a gravity as inscrutable as that of the newly born on his right. Only one incident occurred to break the monotony of the curious procession. As Kentuck bent over the candle-box half curiously, the child turned, and, in a spasm of pain, caught at his groping finger, and held it fast for a moment. Kentuck looked foolish and embarrassed. Something like a blush tried to assert itself in his weather-beaten cheek. \"The damned little cuss!\" he said, as he extricated his finger, with perhaps more tenderness and care than he might have been deemed capable of showing. He held that finger a little apart from its fellows as he went out, and examined it curiously. The examination provoked the same original remark in regard to the child. In fact, he seemed to enjoy repeating it. \"He rastled with my finger,\" he remarked to Tipton, holding up the member, \"the damned little cuss!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was four o'clock before the camp sought repose. A light burnt in the cabin where the watchers sat, for Stumpy did not go to bed that night. Nor did Kentuck. He drank quite freely, and related with great gusto his experience, invariably ending with his characteristic condemnation of the newcomer. It seemed to relieve him of any unjust implication of sentiment, and Kentuck had the weaknesses of the nobler sex. When everybody else had gone to bed, he walked down to the river and whistled reflectingly. Then he walked up the gulch past the cabin, still whistling with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood-tree he paused and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin. Halfway down to the river's bank he again paused, and then returned and knocked at the door. It was opened by Stumpy. \"How goes it?\" said Kentuck, looking past Stumpy toward the candle-box. \"All serene!\" replied Stumpy. \"Anything up?\" \"Nothing.\" There was a pause--an embarrassing one--Stumpy still holding the door. Then Kentuck had recourse to his finger, which he held up to Stumpy. \"Rastled with it,--the damned little cuss,\" he said, and retired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Cherokee Sal had such rude sepulture as Roaring Camp afforded. After her body had been committed to the hillside, there was a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what should be done with her infant. A resolution to adopt it was unanimous and enthusiastic. But an animated discussion in regard to the manner and feasibility of providing for its wants at once sprang up. It was remarkable that the argument partook of none of those fierce personalities with which discussions were usually conducted at Roaring Camp. Tipton proposed that they should send the child to Red Dog,--a distance of forty miles,--where female attention could be procured. But the unlucky suggestion met with fierce and unanimous opposition. It was evident that no plan which entailed parting from their new acquisition would for a moment be entertained. \"Besides,\" said Tom Ryder, \"them fellows at Red Dog would swap it, and ring in somebody else on us.\" A disbelief in the honesty of other camps prevailed at Roaring Camp, as in other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction of a female nurse in the camp also met with objection. It was argued that no decent woman could be prevailed to accept Roaring Camp as her home, and the speaker urged that \"they didn't want any more of the other kind.\" This unkind allusion to the defunct mother, harsh as it may seem, was the first spasm of propriety,--the first symptom of the camp's regeneration. Stumpy advanced nothing. Perhaps he felt a certain delicacy in interfering with the selection of a possible successor in office. But when questioned, he averred stoutly that he and \"Jinny\"--the mammal before alluded to--could manage to rear the child. There was something original, independent, and heroic about the plan that pleased the camp. Stumpy was retained. Certain articles were sent for to Sacramento. \"Mind,\" said the treasurer, as he pressed a bag of gold-dust into the expressman's hand, \"the best that can be got,--lace, you know, and filigree-work and frills,--damn the cost!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Strange to say, the child thrived. Perhaps the invigorating climate of the mountain camp was compensation for material deficiencies. Nature took the foundling to her broader breast. In that rare atmosphere of the Sierra foothills,--that air pungent with balsamic odor, that ethereal cordial at once bracing and exhilarating,--he may have found food and nourishment, or a subtle chemistry that transmuted ass's milk to lime and phosphorus. Stumpy inclined to the belief that it was the latter and good nursing. \"Me and that ass,\" he would say, \"has been father and mother to him! Don't you,\" he would add, apostrophizing the helpless bundle before him, \"never go back on us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time he was a month old the necessity of giving him a name became apparent. He had generally been known as \"The Kid,\" \"Stumpy's Boy,\" \"The Coyote\" (an allusion to his vocal powers), and even by Kentuck's endearing diminutive of \"The damned little cuss.\" But these were felt to be vague and unsatisfactory, and were at last dismissed under another influence. Gamblers and adventurers are generally superstitious, and Oakhurst one day declared that the baby had brought \"the luck\" to Roaring Camp. It was certain that of late they had been successful. \"Luck\" was the name agreed upon, with the prefix of Tommy for greater convenience. No allusion was made to the mother, and the father was unknown. \"It's better,\" said the philosophical Oakhurst, \"to take a fresh deal all round. Call him Luck, and start him fair.\" A day was accordingly set apart for the christening. What was meant by this ceremony the reader may imagine who has already gathered some idea of the reckless irreverence of Roaring Camp. The master of ceremonies was one \"Boston,\" a noted wag, and the occasion seemed to promise the greatest facetiousness. This ingenious satirist had spent two days in preparing a burlesque of the Church service, with pointed local allusions. The choir was properly trained, and Sandy Tipton was to stand godfather. But after the procession had marched to the grove with music and banners, and the child had been deposited before a mock altar, Stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd. \"It ain't my style to spoil fun, boys,\" said the little man, stoutly eyeing the faces around him,\" but it strikes me that this thing ain't exactly on the squar. It's playing it pretty low down on this yer baby to ring in fun on him that he ain't goin' to understand. And ef there's goin' to be any godfathers round, I'd like to see who's got any better rights than me.\" A silence followed Stumpy's speech. To the credit of all humorists be it said that the first man to acknowledge its justice was the satirist thus stopped of his fun. \"But,\" said Stumpy, quickly following up his advantage, \"we're here for a christening, and we'll have it. I proclaim you Thomas Luck, according to the laws of the United States and the State of California, so help me God.\" It was the first time that the name of the Deity had been otherwise uttered than profanely in the camp. The form of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous than the satirist had conceived; but strangely enough, nobody saw it and nobody laughed. \"Tommy\" was christened as seriously as he would have been under a Christian roof and cried and was comforted in as orthodox fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so the work of regeneration began in Roaring Camp. Almost imperceptibly a change came over the settlement. The cabin assigned to \"Tommy Luck\"--or \"The Luck,\" as he was more frequently called--first showed signs of improvement. It was kept scrupulously clean and whitewashed. Then it was boarded, clothed, and papered. The rose wood cradle, packed eighty miles by mule, had, in Stumpy's way of putting it, \"sorter killed the rest of the furniture.\" So the rehabilitation of the cabin became a necessity. The men who were in the habit of lounging in at Stumpy's to see \"how 'The Luck' got on\" seemed to appreciate the change, and in self-defense the rival establishment of \"Tuttle's grocery\" bestirred itself and imported a carpet and mirrors. The reflections of the latter on the appearance of Roaring Camp tended to produce stricter habits of personal cleanliness. Again Stumpy imposed a kind of quarantine upon those who aspired to the honor and privilege of holding The Luck. It was a cruel mortification to Kentuck--who, in the carelessness of a large nature and the habits of frontier life, had begun to regard all garments as a second cuticle, which, like a snake's, only sloughed off through decay--to be debarred this privilege from certain prudential reasons. Yet such was the subtle influence of innovation that he thereafter appeared regularly every afternoon in a clean shirt and face still shining from his ablutions. Nor were moral and social sanitary laws neglected. \"Tommy,\" who was supposed to spend his whole existence in a persistent attempt to repose, must not be disturbed by noise. The shouting and yelling, which had gained the camp its infelicitous title, were not permitted within hearing distance of Stumpy's. The men conversed in whispers or smoked with Indian gravity. Profanity was tacitly given up in these sacred precincts, and throughout the camp a popular form of expletive, known as \"D--n the luck!\" and \"Curse the luck!\" was abandoned, as having a new personal bearing. Vocal music was not interdicted, being supposed to have a soothing, tranquilizing quality; and one song, sung by \"Man-o'-War Jack,\" an English sailor from her Majesty's Australian colonies, was quite popular as a lullaby. It was a lugubrious recital of the exploits of \"the Arethusa, Seventy-four,\" in a muffled minor, ending with a prolonged dying fall at the burden of each verse, \"On b-oo-o-ard of the Arethusa.\" It was a fine sight to see Jack holding The Luck, rocking from side to side as if with the motion of a ship, and crooning forth this naval ditty. Either through the peculiar rocking of Jack or the length of his song,--it contained ninety stanzas, and was continued with conscientious deliberation to the bitter end,--the lullaby generally had the desired effect. At such times the men would lie at full length under the trees in the soft summer twilight, smoking their pipes and drinking in the melodious utterances. An indistinct idea that this was pastoral happiness pervaded the camp. \"This 'ere kind o' think,\" said the Cockney Simmons, meditatively reclining on his elbow, \"is 'evingly.\" It reminded him of Greenwich.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the long summer days The Luck was usually carried to the gulch from whence the golden store of Roaring Camp was taken. There, on a blanket spread over pine boughs, he would lie while the men were working in the ditches below. Latterly there was a rude attempt to decorate this bower with flowers and sweet-smelling shrubs, and generally some one would bring him a cluster of wild honeysuckles, azaleas, or the painted blossoms of Las Mariposas. The men had suddenly awakened to the fact that there were beauty and significance in these trifles, which they had so long trodden carelessly beneath their feet. A flake of glittering mica, a fragment of variegated quartz, a bright pebble from the bed of the creek, became beautiful to eyes thus cleared and strengthened, and were invariably pat aside for The Luck. It was wonderful how many treasures the woods and hillsides yielded that \"would do for Tommy.\" Surrounded by playthings such as never child out of fairyland had before, it is to he hoped that Tommy was content. He appeared to be serenely happy, albeit there was an infantine gravity about him, a contemplative light in his round gray eyes, that sometimes worried Stumpy. He was always tractable and quiet, and it is recorded that once, having crept beyond his \"corral,\"--a hedge of tessellated pine boughs, which surrounded his bed,--he dropped over the bank on his head in the soft earth, and remained with his mottled legs in the air in that position for at least five minutes with unflinching gravity. He was extricated without a murmur. I hesitate to record the many other instances of his sagacity, which rest, unfortunately, upon the statements of prejudiced friends. Some of them were not without a tinge of superstition. \"I crep' up the bank just now,\" said Kentuck one day, in a breathless state of excitement \"and dern my skin if he was a-talking to a jay bird as was a-sittin' on his lap. There they was, just as free and sociable as anything you please, a- jawin' at each other just like two cherrybums.\" Howbeit, whether creeping over the pine boughs or lying lazily on his back blinking at the leaves above him, to him the birds sang, the squirrels chattered, and the flowers bloomed. Nature was his nurse and playfellow. For him she would let slip between the leaves golden shafts of sunlight that fell just within his grasp; she would send wandering breezes to visit him with the balm of bay and resinous gum; to him the tall redwoods nodded familiarly and sleepily, the bumblebees buzzed, and the rooks cawed a slumbrous accompaniment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the golden summer of Roaring Camp. They were \"flush times,\" and the luck was with them. The claims had yielded enormously. The camp was jealous of its privileges and looked suspiciously on strangers. No encouragement was given to immigration, and, to make their seclusion more perfect, the land on either side of the mountain wall that surrounded the camp they duly preempted. This, and a reputation for singular proficiency with the revolver, kept the reserve of Roaring Camp inviolate. The expressman--their only connecting link with the surrounding world-- sometimes told wonderful stories of the camp. He would say, \"They've a street up there in 'Roaring' that would lay over any street in Red Dog. They've got vines and flowers round their houses, and they wash themselves twice a day. But they're mighty rough on strangers, and they worship an Ingin baby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the prosperity of the camp came a desire for further improvement. It was proposed to build a hotel in the following spring, and to invite one or two decent families to reside there for the sake of The Luck, who might perhaps profit by female companionship. The sacrifice that this concession to the sex cost these men, who were fiercely skeptical in regard to its general virtue and usefulness, can only be accounted for by their affection for Tommy. A few still held out. But the resolve could not be carried into effect for three months, and the minority meekly yielded in the hope that something might turn up to prevent it. And it did.\n",
      "\n",
      "The winter of 1851 will long be remembered in the foothills. The snow lay deep on the Sierras, and every mountain creek became a river, and every river a lake. Each gorge and gulch was transformed into a tumultuous watercourse that descended the hillsides, tearing down giant trees and scattering its drift and debris along the plain. Red Dog had been twice under water, and Roaring Camp had been forewarned. \"Water put the gold into them gulches,\" said Stumpy. \"It been here once and will be here again!\" And that night the North Fork suddenly leaped over its banks and swept up the triangular valley of Roaring Camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the confusion of rushing water, crashing trees, and crackling timber, and the darkness which seemed to flow with the water and blot out the fair valley, but little could be done to collect the scattered camp. When the morning broke, the cabin of Stumpy, nearest the river-bank, was gone. Higher up the gulch they found the body of its unlucky owner; but the pride, the hope, the joy, The Luck, of Roaring Camp had disappeared. They were returning with sad hearts when a shout from the bank recalled them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a relief-boat from down the river. They had picked up, they said, a man and an infant, nearly exhausted, about two miles below. Did anybody know them, and did they belong here?\n",
      "\n",
      "It needed but a glance to show them Kentuck lying there, cruelly crushed and bruised, but still holding The Luck of Roaring Camp in his arms. As they bent over the strangely assorted pair, they saw that the child was cold and pulseless. \"He is dead,\" said one. Kentuck opened his eyes. \"Dead?\" he repeated feebly. \"Yes, my man, and you are dying too.\" A smile lit the eyes of the expiring Kentuck. \"Dying!\" he repeated; \"he's a-taking me with him. Tell the boys I've got The Luck with me now;\" and the strong man, clinging to the frail babe as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw, drifted away into the shadowy river that flows forever to the unknown sea.\n",

      "I do not think that we ever knew his real name. Our ignorance of it certainly never gave us any social inconvenience, for at Sandy Bar in 1854 most men were christened anew. Sometimes these appellatives were derived from some distinctiveness of dress, as in the case of \"Dungaree Jack\"; or from some peculiarity of habit, as shown in \"Saleratus Bill,\" so called from an undue proportion of that chemical in his daily bread; or for some unlucky slip, as exhibited in \"The Iron Pirate,\" a mild, inoffensive man, who earned that baleful title by his unfortunate mispronunciation of the term \"iron pyrites.\" Perhaps this may have been the beginning of a rude heraldry; but I am constrained to think that it was because a man's real name in that day rested solely upon his own unsupported statement. \"Call yourself Clifford, do you?\" said Boston, addressing a timid newcomer with infinite scorn; \"hell is full of such Cliffords!\" He then introduced the unfortunate man, whose name happened to be really Clifford, as \"Jay-bird Charley\"--an unhallowed inspiration of the moment that clung to him ever after.\n",
      "But to return to Tennessee's Partner, whom we never knew by any other than this relative title; that he had ever existed as a separate and distinct individuality we only learned later. It seems that in 1853 he left Poker Flat to go to San Francisco, ostensibly to procure a wife. He never got any farther than Stockton. At that place he was attracted by a young person who waited upon the table at the hotel where he took his meals. One morning he said something to her which caused her to smile not unkindly, to somewhat coquettishly break a plate of toast over his upturned, serious, simple face, and to retreat to the kitchen. He followed her, and emerged a few moments later, covered with more toast and victory. That day week they were married by a justice of the peace, and returned to Poker Flat. I am aware that something more might be made of this episode, but I prefer to tell it as it was current at Sandy Bar--in the gulches and barrooms--where all sentiment was modified by a strong sense of humor.\n",
      "Of their married felicity but little is known, perhaps for the reason that Tennessee, then living with his Partner, one day took occasion to say something to the bride on his own account, at which, it is said, she smiled not unkindly and chastely retreated-- this time as far as Marysville, where Tennessee followed her, and where they went to housekeeping without the aid of a justice of the peace. Tennessee's Partner took the loss of his wife simply and seriously, as was his fashion. But to everybody's surprise, when Tennessee one day returned from Marysville, without his Partner's wife--she having smiled and retreated with somebody else-- Tennessee's Partner was the first man to shake his hand and greet him with affection. The boys who had gathered in the canyon to see the shooting were naturally indignant. Their indignation might have found vent in sarcasm but for a certain look in Tennessee's Partner's eye that indicated a lack of humorous appreciation. In fact, he was a grave man, with a steady application to practical detail which was unpleasant in a difficulty.\n",
      "Meanwhile a popular feeling against Tennessee had grown up on the Bar. He was known to be a gambler; he was suspected to be a thief. In these suspicions Tennessee's Partner was equally compromised; his continued intimacy with Tennessee after the affair above quoted could only be accounted for on the hypothesis of a copartnership of crime. At last Tennessee's guilt became flagrant. One day he overtook a stranger on his way to Red Dog. The stranger afterward related that Tennessee beguiled the time with interesting anecdote and reminiscence, but illogically concluded the interview in the following words: \"And now, young man, I'll trouble you for your knife, your pistols, and your money. You see your weppings might get you into trouble at Red Dog, and your money's a temptation to the evilly disposed. I think you said your address was San Francisco. I shall endeavor to call.\" It may be stated here that Tennessee had a fine flow of humor, which no business preoccupation could wholly subdue.\n",
      "This exploit was his last. Red Dog and Sandy Bar made common cause against the highwayman. Tennessee was hunted in very much the same fashion as his prototype, the grizzly. As the toils closed around him, he made a desperate dash through the Bar, emptying his revolver at the crowd before the Arcade Saloon, and so on up Grizzly Canyon; but at its farther extremity he was stopped by a small man on a gray horse. The men looked at each other a moment in silence. Both were fearless, both self-possessed and independent; and both types of a civilization that in the seventeenth century would have been called heroic, but, in the nineteenth, simply \"reckless.\" \"What have you got there?--I call,\" said Tennessee, quietly. \"Two bowers and an ace,\" said the stranger, as quietly, showing two revolvers and a bowie knife. \"That takes me,\" returned Tennessee; and with this gamblers' epigram, he threw away his useless pistol, and rode back with his captor.\n",
      "It was a warm night. The cool breeze which usually sprang up with the going down of the sun behind the chaparral-crested mountain was that evening withheld from Sandy Bar. The little canyon was stifling with heated resinous odors, and the decaying driftwood on the Bar sent forth faint, sickening exhalations. The feverishness of day, and its fierce passions, still filled the camp. Lights moved restlessly along the bank of the river, striking no answering reflection from its tawny current. Against the blackness of the pines the windows of the old loft above the express office stood out staringly bright; and through their curtainless panes the loungers below could see the forms of those who were even then deciding the fate of Tennessee. And above all this, etched on the dark firmament, rose the Sierra, remote and passionless, crowned with remoter passionless stars.\n",
      "The trial of Tennessee was conducted as fairly as was consistent with a judge and jury who felt themselves to some extent obliged to justify, in their verdict, the previous irregularities of arrest and indictment. The law of Sandy Bar was implacable, but not vengeful. The excitement and personal feeling of the chase were over; with Tennessee safe in their hands they were ready to listen patiently to any defense, which they were already satisfied was insufficient. There being no doubt in their own minds, they were willing to give the prisoner the benefit of any that might exist. Secure in the hypothesis that he ought to be hanged, on general principles, they indulged him with more latitude of defense than his reckless hardihood seemed to ask. The Judge appeared to be more anxious than the prisoner, who, otherwise unconcerned, evidently took a grim pleasure in the responsibility he had created. \"I don't take any hand in this yer game,\" had been his invariable but good-humored reply to all questions. The Judge--who was also his captor--for a moment vaguely regretted that he had not shot him \"on sight\" that morning, but presently dismissed this human weakness as unworthy of the judicial mind. Nevertheless, when there was a tap at the door, and it was said that Tennessee's Partner was there on behalf of the prisoner, he was admitted at once without question. Perhaps the younger members of the jury, to whom the proceedings were becoming irksomely thoughtful, hailed him as a relief.\n",
      "For he was not, certainly, an imposing figure. Short and stout, with a square face sunburned into a preternatural redness, clad in a loose duck \"jumper\" and trousers streaked and splashed with red soil, his aspect under any circumstances would have been quaint, and was now even ridiculous. As he stooped to deposit at his feet a heavy carpetbag he was carrying, it became obvious, from partially developed legends and inscriptions, that the material with which his trousers had been patched had been originally intended for a less ambitious covering. Yet he advanced with great gravity, and after having shaken the hand of each person in the room with labored cordiality, he wiped his serious, perplexed face on a red bandanna handkerchief, a shade lighter than his complexion, laid his powerful hand upon the table to steady himself, and thus addressed the Judge:\n",
      "\"I was passin' by,\" he began, by way of apology, \"and I thought I'd just step in and see how things was gittin' on with Tennessee thar-- my pardner. It's a hot night. I disremember any sich weather before on the Bar.\"\n",
      "He paused a moment, but nobody volunteering any other meteorological recollection, he again had recourse to his pocket handkerchief, and for some moments mopped his face diligently.\n",
      "\"Have you anything to say in behalf of the prisoner?\" said the Judge, finally.\n",
      "\"Thet's it,\" said Tennessee's Partner, in a tone of relief. \"I come yar as Tennessee's pardner--knowing him nigh on four year, off and on, wet and dry, in luck and out o' luck. His ways ain't allers my ways, but thar ain't any p'ints in that young man, thar ain't any liveliness as he's been up to, as I don't know. And you sez to me, sez you--confidential-like, and between man and man--sez you, 'Do you know anything in his behalf?' and I sez to you, sez I-- confidential-like, as between man and man--'What should a man know of his pardner?'\"\n",
      "\"Is this all you have to say?\" asked the Judge impatiently, feeling, perhaps, that a dangerous sympathy of humor was beginning to humanize the Court.\n",
      "\"Thet's so,\" continued Tennessee's Partner. \"It ain't for me to say anything agin' him. And now, what's the case? Here's Tennessee wants money, wants it bad, and doesn't like to ask it of his old pardner. Well, what does Tennessee do? He lays for a stranger, and he fetches that stranger. And you lays for HIM, and you fetches HIM; and the honors is easy. And I put it to you, bein' a far-minded man, and to you, gentlemen, all, as far-minded men, ef this isn't so.\"\n",
      "\"Prisoner,\" said the Judge, interrupting, \"have you any questions to ask this man?\"\n",
      "\"No! no!\" continued Tennessee's Partner, hastily. \"I play this yer hand alone. To come down to the bedrock, it's just this: Tennessee, thar, has played it pretty rough and expensive-like on a stranger, and on this yer camp. And now, what's the fair thing? Some would say more; some would say less. Here's seventeen hundred dollars in coarse gold and a watch--it's about all my pile--and call it square!\" And before a hand could be raised to prevent him, he had emptied the contents of the carpetbag upon the table.\n",
      "For a moment his life was in jeopardy. One or two men sprang to their feet, several hands groped for hidden weapons, and a suggestion to \"throw him from the window\" was only overridden by a gesture from the Judge. Tennessee laughed. And apparently oblivious of the excitement, Tennessee's Partner improved the opportunity to mop his face again with his handkerchief.\n",
      "When order was restored, and the man was made to understand, by the use of forcible figures and rhetoric, that Tennessee's offense could not be condoned by money, his face took a more serious and sanguinary hue, and those who were nearest to him noticed that his rough hand trembled slightly on the table. He hesitated a moment as he slowly returned the gold to the carpetbag, as if he had not yet entirely caught the elevated sense of justice which swayed the tribunal, and was perplexed with the belief that he had not offered enough. Then he turned to the Judge, and saying, \"This yer is a lone hand, played alone, and without my pardner,\" he bowed to the jury and was about to withdraw when the Judge called him back. \"If you have anything to say to Tennessee, you had better say it now.\" For the first time that evening the eyes of the prisoner and his strange advocate met. Tennessee smiled, showed his white teeth, and, saying, \"Euchred, old man!\" held out his hand. Tennessee's Partner took it in his own, and saying, \"I just dropped in as I was passin' to see how things was getting' on,\" let the hand passively fall, and adding that it was a warm night, again mopped his face with his handkerchief, and without another word withdrew.\n",
      "The two men never again met each other alive. For the unparalleled insult of a bribe offered to Judge Lynch--who, whether bigoted, weak, or narrow, was at least incorruptible--firmly fixed in the mind of that mythical personage any wavering determination of Tennessee's fate; and at the break of day he was marched, closely guarded, to meet it at the top of Marley's Hill.\n",
      "How he met it, how cool he was, how he refused to say anything, how perfect were the arrangements of the committee, were all duly reported, with the addition of a warning moral and example to all future evildoers, in the RED DOG CLARION, by its editor, who was present, and to whose vigorous English I cheerfully refer the reader. But the beauty of that midsummer morning, the blessed amity of earth and air and sky, the awakened life of the free woods and hills, the joyous renewal and promise of Nature, and above all, the infinite Serenity that thrilled through each, was not reported, as not being a part of the social lesson. And yet, when the weak and foolish deed was done, and a life, with its possibilities and responsibilities, had passed out of the misshapen thing that dangled between earth and sky, the birds sang, the flowers bloomed, the sun shone, as cheerily as before; and possibly the RED DOG CLARION was right.\n",
      "Tennessee's Partner was not in the group that surrounded the ominous tree. But as they turned to disperse attention was drawn to the singular appearance of a motionless donkey cart halted at the side of the road. As they approached, they at once recognized the venerable \"Jenny\" and the two-wheeled cart as the property of Tennessee's Partner--used by him in carrying dirt from his claim; and a few paces distant the owner of the equipage himself, sitting under a buckeye tree, wiping the perspiration from his glowing face. In answer to an inquiry, he said he had come for the body of the \"diseased,\" \"if it was all the same to the committee.\" He didn't wish to \"hurry anything\"; he could \"wait.\" He was not working that day; and when the gentlemen were done with the \"diseased,\" he would take him. \"Ef thar is any present,\" he added, in his simple, serious way, \"as would care to jine in the fun'l, they kin come.\" Perhaps it was from a sense of humor, which I have already intimated was a feature of Sandy Bar--perhaps it was from something even better than that; but two-thirds of the loungers accepted the invitation at once.\n",
      "It was noon when the body of Tennessee was delivered into the hands of his Partner. As the cart drew up to the fatal tree, we noticed that it contained a rough, oblong box--apparently made from a section of sluicing and half-filled with bark and the tassels of pine. The cart was further decorated with slips of willow, and made fragrant with buckeye blossoms. When the body was deposited in the box, Tennessee's Partner drew over it a piece of tarred canvas, and gravely mounting the narrow seat in front, with his feet upon the shafts, urged the little donkey forward. The equipage moved slowly on, at that decorous pace which was habitual with \"Jenny\" even under less solemn circumstances. The men--half curiously, half jestingly, but all good-humoredly--strolled along beside the cart; some in advance, some a little in the rear of the homely catafalque. But, whether from the narrowing of the road or some present sense of decorum, as the cart passed on, the company fell to the rear in couples, keeping step, and otherwise assuming the external show of a formal procession. Jack Folinsbee, who had at the outset played a funeral march in dumb show upon an imaginary trombone, desisted, from a lack of sympathy and appreciation--not having, perhaps, your true humorist's capacity to be content with the enjoyment of his own fun.\n",
      "The way led through Grizzly Canyon--by this time clothed in funereal drapery and shadows. The redwoods, burying their moccasined feet in the red soil, stood in Indian file along the track, trailing an uncouth benediction from their bending boughs upon the passing bier. A hare, surprised into helpless inactivity, sat upright and pulsating in the ferns by the roadside as the cortege went by. Squirrels hastened to gain a secure outlook from higher boughs; and the bluejays, spreading their wings, fluttered before them like outriders, until the outskirts of Sandy Bar were reached, and the solitary cabin of Tennessee's Partner.\n",
      "Viewed under more favorable circumstances, it would not have been a cheerful place. The unpicturesque site, the rude and unlovely outlines, the unsavory details, which distinguish the nest-building of the California miner, were all here, with the dreariness of decay superadded. A few paces from the cabin there was a rough enclosure, which in the brief days of Tennessee's Partner's matrimonial felicity had been used as a garden, but was now overgrown with fern. As we approached it we were surprised to find that what we had taken for a recent attempt at cultivation was the broken soil about an open grave.\n",
      "The cart was halted before the enclosure; and rejecting the offers of assistance with the same air of simple self-reliance he had displayed throughout, Tennessee's Partner lifted the rough coffin on his back and deposited it, unaided, within the shallow grave. He then nailed down the board which served as a lid; and mounting the little mound of earth beside it, took off his hat, and slowly mopped his face with his handkerchief. This the crowd felt was a preliminary to speech; and they disposed themselves variously on stumps and boulders, and sat expectant.\n",
      "\"When a man,\" began Tennessee's Partner, slowly, \"has been running free all day, what's the natural thing for him to do? Why, to come home. And if he ain't in a condition to go home, what can his best friend do? Why, bring him home! And here's Tennessee has been running free, and we brings him home from his wandering.\" He paused, and picked up a fragment of quartz, rubbed it thoughtfully on his sleeve, and went on: \"It ain't the first time that I've packed him on my back, as you see'd me now. It ain't the first time that I brought him to this yer cabin when he couldn't help himself; it ain't the first time that I and 'Jinny' have waited for him on yon hill, and picked him up and so fetched him home, when he couldn't speak, and didn't know me. And now that it's the last time, why\"--he paused and rubbed the quartz gently on his sleeve--\"you see it's sort of rough on his pardner. And now, gentlemen,\" he added, abruptly, picking up his long-handled shovel, \"the fun'l's over; and my thanks, and Tennessee's thanks, to you for your trouble.\"\n",
      "Resisting any proffers of assistance, he began to fill in the grave, turning his back upon the crowd that after a few moments' hesitation gradually withdrew. As they crossed the little ridge that hid Sandy Bar from view, some, looking back, thought they could see Tennessee's Partner, his work done, sitting upon the grave, his shovel between his knees, and his face buried in his red bandanna handkerchief. But it was argued by others that you couldn't tell his face from his handkerchief at that distance; and this point remained undecided.\n",
      "In the reaction that followed the feverish excitement of that day, Tennessee's Partner was not forgotten. A secret investigation had cleared him of any complicity in Tennessee's guilt, and left only a suspicion of his general sanity. Sandy Bar made a point of calling on him, and proffering various uncouth, but well-meant kindnesses. But from that day his rude health and great strength seemed visibly to decline; and when the rainy season fairly set in, and the tiny grass-blades were beginning to peep from the rocky mound above Tennessee's grave, he took to his bed. One night, when the pines beside the cabin were swaying in the storm, and trailing their slender fingers over the roof, and the roar and rush of the swollen river were heard below, Tennessee's Partner lifted his head from the pillow, saying, \"It is time to go for Tennessee; I must put 'Jinny' in the cart\"; and would have risen from his bed but for the restraint of his attendant. Struggling, he still pursued his singular fancy: \"There, now, steady, 'Jinny'--steady, old girl. How dark it is! Look out for the ruts--and look out for him, too, old gal. Sometimes, you know, when he's blind-drunk, he drops down right in the trail. Keep on straight up to the pine on the top of the hill. Thar--I told you so!--thar he is--coming this way, too--all by himself, sober, and his face a-shining. Tennessee! Pardner!\"\n",
      "And so they met.\n",

      "One September night a family had gathered round their hearth, and piled it high with the driftwood of mountain streams, the dry cones of the pine, and the splintered ruins of great trees that had come crashing down the precipice. Up the chimney roared the fire, and brightened the room with its broad blaze. The faces of the father and mother had a sober gladness; the children laughed; the eldest daughter was the image of Happiness at seventeen; and the aged grandmother, who sat knitting in the warmest place, was the image of Happiness grown old. They had found the \"herb, heart's-ease,\" in the bleakest spot of all New England. This family were situated in the Notch of the White Hills, where the wind was sharp throughout the year, and pitilessly cold in the winter--giving their cottage all its fresh inclemency before it descended on the valley of the Saco. They dwelt in a cold spot and a dangerous one; for a mountain towered above their heads, so steep, that the stones would often rumble down its sides and startle them at midnight.\n",
      "The daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them all with mirth, when the wind came through the Notch and seemed to pause before their cottage--rattling the door, with a sound of wailing and lamentation, before it passed into the valley. For a moment it saddened them, though there was nothing unusual in the tones. But the family were glad again when they perceived that the latch was lifted by some traveller, whose footsteps had been unheard amid the dreary blast which heralded his approach, and wailed as he was entering, and went moaning away from the door.\n",
      "Though they dwelt in such a solitude, these people held daily converse with the world. The romantic pass of the Notch is a great artery, through which the life-blood of internal commerce is continually throbbing between Maine, on one side, and the Green Mountains and the shores of the St. Lawrence, on the other. The stage-coach always drew up before the door of the cottage. The way-farer, with no companion but his staff, paused here to exchange a word, that the sense of loneliness might not utterly overcome him ere he could pass through the cleft of the mountain, or reach the first house in the valley. And here the teamster, on his way to Portland market, would put up for the night; and, if a bachelor, might sit an hour beyond the usual bedtime, and steal a kiss from the mountain maid at parting. It was one of those primitive taverns where the traveller pays only for food and lodging, but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price. When the footsteps were heard, therefore, between the outer door and the inner one, the whole family rose up, grandmother, children, and all, as if about to welcome someone who belonged to them, and whose fate was linked with theirs.\n",
      "The door was opened by a young man. His face at first wore the melancholy expression, almost despondency, of one who travels a wild and bleak road, at nightfall and alone, but soon brightened up when he saw the kindly warmth of his reception. He felt his heart spring forward to meet them all, from the old woman, who wiped a chair with her apron, to the little child that held out its arms to him. One glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent familiarity with the eldest daughter.\n",
      "\"Ah, this fire is the right thing!\" cried he; \"especially when there is such a pleasant circle round it. I am quite benumbed; for the Notch is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows; it has blown a terrible blast in my face all the way from Bartlett.\"\n",
      "\"Then you are going towards Vermont?\" said the master of the house, as he helped to take a light knapsack off the young man's shoulders.\n",
      "\"Yes; to Burlington, and far enough beyond,\" replied he. \"I meant to have been at Ethan Crawford's tonight; but a pedestrian lingers along such a road as this. It is no matter; for, when I saw this good fire, and all your cheerful faces, I felt as if you had kindled it on purpose for me, and were waiting my arrival. So I shall sit down among you, and make myself at home.\"\n",
      "The frank-hearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire when something like a heavy footstep was heard without, rushing down the steep side of the mountain, as with long and rapid strides, and taking such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite precipice. The family held their breath, because they knew the sound, and their guest held his by instinct.\n",
      "\"The old mountain has thrown a stone at us, for fear we should forget him,\" said the landlord, recovering himself. \"He sometimes nods his head and threatens to come down; but we are old neighbors, and agree together pretty well upon the whole. Besides we have a sure place of refuge hard by if he should be coming in good earnest.\"\n",
      "Let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of bear's meat; and, by his natural felicity of manner, to have placed himself on a footing of kindness with the whole family, so that they talked as freely together as if he belonged to their mountain brood. He was of a proud, yet gentle spirit--haughty and reserved among the rich and great; but ever ready to stoop his head to the lowly cottage door, and be like a brother or a son at the poor man's fireside. In the household of the Notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling, the pervading intelligence of New England, and a poetry of native growth, which they had gathered when they little thought of it from the mountain peaks and chasms, and at the very threshold of their romantic and dangerous abode. He had travelled far and alone; his whole life, indeed, had been a solitary path; for, with the lofty caution of his nature, he had kept himself apart from those who might otherwise have been his companions. The family, too, though so kind and hospitable, had that consciousness of unity among themselves, and separation from the world at large, which, in every domestic circle, should still keep a holy place where no stranger may intrude. But this evening a prophetic sympathy impelled the refined and educated youth to pour out his heart before the simple mountaineers, and constrained them to answer him with the same free confidence. And thus it should have been. Is not the kindred of a common fate a closer tie than that of birth?\n",
      "The secret of the young man's character was a high and abstracted ambition. He could have borne to live an undistinguished life, but not to be forgotten in the grave. Yearning desire had been transformed to hope; and hope, long cherished, had become like certainty, that, obscurely as he journeyed now, a glory was to beam on all his pathway-though not, perhaps, while he was treading it. But when posterity should gaze back into the gloom of what was now the present, they would trace the brightness of his footsteps, brightening as meaner glories faded, and confess that a gifted one had passed from his cradle to his tomb with none to recognize him.\n",
      "\"As yet,\" cried the stranger--his cheek glowing and his eye flashing with enthusiasm--\"as yet, I have done nothing. Were I to vanish from the earth tomorrow, none would know so much of me as you: that a nameless youth came up at nightfall from the valley of the Saco, and opened his heart to you in the evening, and passed through the Notch by sunrise, and was seen no more. Not a soul would ask, 'Who was he? Whither did the wanderer go?' But I cannot die till I have achieved my destiny. Then, let Death come! I shall have built my monument!\"\n",
      "There was a continual flow of natural emotion, gushing forth amid abstracted reverie, which enabled the family to understand this young man's sentiments, though so foreign from their own. With quick sensibility of the ludicrous, he blushed at the ardor into which he had been betrayed.\n",
      "\"You laugh at me,\" said he, taking the eldest daughter's hand, and laughing himself. \"You think my ambition as nonsensical as if I were to freeze myself to death on the top of Mount Washington, only that people might spy at me from the country round about. And, truly, that would be a noble pedestal for a man's statue!\"\n",
      "\"It is better to sit here by this fire,\" answered the girl, blushing, \"and be comfortable and contented, though nobody thinks about us.\"\n",
      "\"I suppose,\" said her father, after a fit of musing, \"there is something natural in what the young man says; and if my mind had been turned that way, I might have felt just the same. It is strange, wife, how his talk has set my head running on things that are pretty certain never to come to pass.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps they may,\" observed the wife. \"Is the man thinking what he will do when he is a widower?\"\n",
      "\"No, no!\" cried he, repelling the idea with reproachful kindness. \"When I think of your death, Esther, I think of mine, too. But I was wishing we had a good farm in Bartlett, or Bethlehem, or Littleton, or some other township round the White Mountains; but not where they could tumble on our heads. I should want to stand well with my neighbors and be called Squire, and sent to General Court for a term or two; for a plain, honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer. And when I should be grown quite an old man, and you an old woman, so as not to be long apart, I might die happy enough in my bed, and leave you all crying around me. A slate gravestone would suit me as well as a marble one--with just my name and age, and a verse of a hymn, and something to let people know that I lived an honest man and died a Christian.\"\n",
      "\"There now!\" exclaimed the stranger; \"it is our nature to desire a monument, be it slate or marble, or a pillar of granite, or a glorious memory in the universal heart of man.\"\n",
      "\"We're in a strange way, tonight,\" said the wife, with tears in her eyes. \"They say it's a sign of something, when folks' minds go a-wandering so. Hark to the children!\"\n",
      "They listened accordingly. The younger children had been put to bed in another room, but with an open door between, so that they could be heard talking busily among themselves. One and all seemed to have caught the infection from the fireside circle, and were outvying each other in wild wishes, and childish projects, of what they would do when they came to be men and women. At length a little boy, instead of addressing his brothers and sisters, called out to his mother.\n",
      "\"I'll tell you what I wish, mother,\" cried he. \"I want you and father and grandma'm, and all of us, and the stranger too, to start right away, and go and take a drink out of the basin of the Flume!\"\n",
      "Nobody could help laughing at the child's notion of leaving a warm bed, and dragging them from a cheerful fire, to visit the basin of the Flume--a brook, which tumbles over the precipice, deep within the Notch. The boy had hardly spoken when a wagon rattled along the road, and stopped a moment before the door. It appeared to contain two or three men, who were cheering their hearts with the rough chorus of a song, which resounded, in broken notes, between the cliffs, while the singers hesitated whether to continue their journey or put up here for the night.\n",
      "\"Father,\" said the girl, \"they are calling you by name.\"\n",
      "But the good man doubted whether they had really called him, and was unwilling to show himself too solicitous of gain by inviting people to patronize his house. He therefore did not hurry to the door; and the lash being soon applied, the travellers plunged into the Notch, still singing and laughing, though their music and mirth came back drearily from the heart of the mountain.\n",
      "\"There, mother!\" cried the boy, again. \"They'd have given us a ride to the Flume.\"\n",
      "Again they laughed at the child's pertinacious fancy for a night ramble. But it happened that a light cloud passed over the daughter's spirit; she looked gravely into the fire, and drew a breath that was almost a sigh. It forced its way, in spite of a little struggle to repress it. Then starting and blushing, she looked quickly round the circle, as if they had caught a glimpse into her bosom. The stranger asked what she had been thinking of.\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" answered she, with a downcast smile. \"Only I felt lonesome just then.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I have always had a gift of feeling what is in other people's hearts,\" said he, half seriously. \"Shall I tell the secrets of yours? For I know what to think when a young girl shivers by a warm hearth, and complains of lonesomeness at her mother's side. Shall I put these feelings into words?\"\n",
      "\"They would not be a girl's feelings any longer if they could be put into words,\" replied the mountain nymph, laughing, but avoiding his eye.\n",
      "All this was said apart. Perhaps a germ of love was springing in their hearts, so pure that it might blossom in Paradise, since it could not be matured on earth; for women worship such gentle dignity as his; and the proud, contemplative, yet kindly soul is oftenest captivated by simplicity like hers. But while they spoke softly, and he was watching the happy sadness, the lightsome shadows, the shy yearnings of a maiden's nature, the wind through the Notch took a deeper and drearier sound. It seemed, as the fanciful stranger said, like the choral strain of the spirits of the blast, who in old Indian times had their dwelling among these mountains, and made their heights and recesses a sacred region.\n",
      "There was a wail along the road, as if a funeral were passing. To chase away the gloom, the family threw pine branches on their fire, till the dry leaves crackled and the flame arose, discovering once again a scene of peace and humble happiness. The light hovered about them fondly, and caressed them all. There were the little faces of the children, peeping from their bed apart, and here the father's frame of strength, the mother's subdued and careful mien, the high-browed youth, the budding girl, and the good old grandam, still knitting in the warmest place. The aged woman looked up from her task, and, with fingers ever busy, was the next to speak.\n",
      "\"Old folks have their notions,\" said she, \"as well as young ones. You've been wishing and planning; and letting your heads run on one thing and another, till you've set my mind a-wandering too. Now what should an old woman wish for, when she can go but a step or two before she comes to her grave? Children, it will haunt me night and day till I tell you.\"\n",
      "\"What is it, mother?\" cried the husband and wife at once.\n",
      "Then the old woman, with an air of mystery which drew the circle closer round the fire, informed them that she had provided her grave-clothes some years before--a nice linen shroud, a cap with a muslin ruff, and everything of a finer sort than she had worn since her wedding day. But this evening an old superstition had strangely recurred to her. It used to be said, in her younger days, that if anything were amiss with a corpse, if only the ruff were not smooth, or the cap did not set right, the corpse in the coffin and beneath the clods would strive to put up its cold hands and arrange it. The bare thought made her nervous.\n",
      "\"Don't talk so, grandmother!\" said the girl, shuddering.\n",
      "\"Now,\" continued the old woman, with singular earnestness, yet smiling strangely at her own folly, \"I want one of you, my children- when your mother is dressed and in the coffin--I want one of you to hold a looking-glass over my face. Who knows but I may take a glimpse at myself, and see whether all's right?\"\n",
      "\"Old and young, we dream of graves and monuments,\" murmured the stranger youth. \"I wonder how mariners feel when the ship is sinking, and they, unknown and undistinguished, are to be buried together in the ocean--that wide and nameless sepulchre?\"\n",
      "For a moment, the old woman's ghastly conception so engrossed the minds of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night, rising like the roar of a blast, had grown broad, deep, and terrible, before the fated group were conscious of it. The house and all within it trembled; the foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken, as if this awful sound were the peal of the last trump. Young and old exchanged one wild glance, and remained an instant, pale, affrighted, without utterance, or power to move. Then the same shriek burst simultaneously from all their lips.\n",
      "\"The Slide! The Slide!\"\n",
      "The simplest words must intimate, but not portray, the unutterable horror of the catastrophe. The victims rushed from their cottage, and sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spot--where, in contemplation of such an emergency, a sort of barrier had been reared. Alas! they had quitted their security, and fled right into the pathway of destruction. Down came the whole side of the mountain, in a cataract of ruin. Just before it reached the house, the stream broke into two branches--shivered not a window there, but overwhelmed the whole vicinity, blocked up the road, and annihilated everything in its dreadful course. Long ere the thunder of the great Slide had ceased to roar among the mountains, the mortal agony had been endured, and the victims were at peace. Their bodies were never found.\n",
      "The next morning, the light smoke was seen stealing from the cottage chimney up the mountain side. Within, the fire was yet smouldering on the hearth, and the chairs in a circle round it, as if the inhabitants had but gone forth to view the devastation of the Slide, and would shortly return, to thank Heaven for their miraculous escape. All had left separate tokens, by which those who had known the family were made to shed a tear for each. Who has not heard their name? The story has been told far and wide, and will forever be a legend of these mountains. Poets have sung their fate.\n",
      "There were circumstances which led some to suppose that a stranger had been received into the cottage on this awful night, and had shared the catastrophe of all its inmates. Others denied that there were sufficient grounds for such a conjecture. Wo for the high-souled youth, with his dream of Earthly Immortality! His name and person utterly unknown; his history, his way of life, his plans, a mystery never to be solved, his death and his existence equally a doubt! Whose was the agony of that death moment?\n",

      "Bartram the lime-burner, a rough, heavy-looking man, begrimed with charcoal, sat watching his kiln, at nightfall, while his little son played at building houses with the scattered fragments of marble, when, on the hill-side below them, they heard a roar of laughter, not mirthful, but slow, and even solemn, like a wind shaking the boughs of the forest.\n",
      "\"Father, what is that\" asked the little boy, leaving his play, and pressing betwixt his father's knees.\n",
      "\"O, some drunken man, I suppose,\" answered the lime-burner; \"some merry fellow from the bar-room in the village, who dared not laugh loud enough within doors, lest he should blow the roof of the house off. So here he is, shaking his jolly sides at the foot of Gray-lock.\"\n",
      "\"But, father,\" said the child, more sensitive than the obtuse, middle-aged clown, \"he does not laugh like a man that is glad. So the noise frightens me!\"\n",
      "\"Don't be a fool, child!\" cried his father, gruffly. \"You will never make a man, I do believe; there is too much of your mother in you. I have known the rustling of a leaf startle you. Hark! Here comes the merry fellow, now. You shall see that there is no harm in him.\"\n",
      "Bartram and his little son, while they were talking thus, sat watching the same lime-kiln that had been the scene of Ethan Brand's solitary and meditative life, before he began his search for the Unpardonable Sin. Many years, as we have seen, had now elapsed, since that portentous night when the IDEA was first developed. The kiln, however, on the mountain-side, stood unimpaired, and was in nothing changed since he had thrown his dark thoughts into the intense glow of its furnace, and melted them, as it were, into the one thought that took possession of his life. It was a rude, round, tower-like structure, about twenty feet high, heavily built of rough stones, and with a hillock of earth heaped about the larger part of its\n",
      "circumference; so that the blocks and fragments of marble might be\n",
      "drawn by cart-loads, and thrown in at the top. There was an opening at the bottom of the tower, like an oven-mouth, but large enough to admit a man in a stooping posture, and provided with a massive iron door. With the smoke and jets of flame issuing from the chinks and crevices of this door, which seemed to give admittance into the hill-side, it resembled nothing so much as the private entrance to the infernal regions, which the shepherds of the Delectable Mountains were accustomed to show to pilgrims.\n",
      "There are  many such lime-kilns in that tract of country, for the purpose of burning the white marble which composes a large part of the substance of the hills. Some of them, built years ago, and long deserted, with weeds growing in the vacant round of the interior, which is open to the sky, and grass and wild-flowers rooting themselves into the chinks of the stones, look already like relics of antiquity, and may yet be overspread with the lichens of centuries to come. Others, where the lime-burner still feeds his daily\n",
      "and nightlong fire, afford points of interest to the wanderer among the hills, who seats himself on a log of wood or a fragment of marble, to hold a chat with the solitary man. It is a lonesome, and, when the character is inclined to thought, may be an intensely thoughtful occupation; as it proved in the case of Ethan Brand, who had mused to such strange purpose, in days gone by, while the fire in this very kiln was burning.\n",
      "The man who now watched the fire was of a different order, and troubled himself with no thoughts save the very few that were requisite to his business. At frequent intervals, he flung back the clashing weight of the iron door, and, turning his face from the insufferable glare, thrust in huge logs of oak, or stirred the immense brands with a long pole. Within the furnace were seen the curling and riotous flames, and the burning marble, almost molten with the intensity of heat; while without, the reflection of the fire quivered on the dark intricacy of the surrounding forest, and showed in the foreground a bright and ruddy little picture of the hut, the spring beside its door, the athletic and coal-begrimed figure of the lime-burner, and the half-frightened child, shrinking into the protection of his father's shadow. And when again the iron door was closed, then reappeared the tender light of the half-full moon, which vainly strove to trace out the indistinct shapes of the neighboring mountains; and, in the upper sky, there was a flitting congregation of clouds, still faintly tinged with the rosy sunset, though thus far down into the valley the sunshine had vanished long and long ago.\n",
      "The little boy now crept still closer to his father, as footsteps were heard ascending the hill-side, and a human form thrust aside the bushes that clustered beneath the trees.\n",
      "\"Halloo! who is it?\" cried the lime-burner, vexed at his son's timidity, yet half infected by it. \"Come forward, and show yourself, like a man, or I'll fling this chunk of marble at your head!\"\n",
      "\"You offer me a rough welcome,\" said a gloomy voice, as the unknown man drew nigh. \"Yet I neither claim nor desire a kinder one, even at\n",
      "my own fireside.\"\n",
      "To obtain a distincter view, Bartram threw open the iron door of the kiln, whence immediately issued a gush of fierce light, that smote full upon the stranger's face and figure. To a careless eye there appeared nothing very remarkable in his aspect, which was that of a man in a coarse, brown, country-made suit of clothes, tall and thin, with the staff and heavy shoes of a wayfarer. As he advanced, he fixed his eyes--which were very bright--intently upon the brightness of the furnace, as if he beheld, or expected to behold, some object worthy of note within it.\n",
      "\"Good evening, stranger,\" said the lime-burner; \"whence come you, so late in the day?\"\n",
      "\"I come from my search,\" answered the wayfarer; \"for, at last, it is finished.\"\n",
      "\"Drunk!--or crazy!\" muttered Bartram to himself. \"I shall have trouble with the fellow. The sooner I drive him away, the better.\"\n",
      "The little boy, all in a tremble, whispered to his father, and begged him to shut the door of the kiln, so that there might not be so much light; for that there was something in the man's face which he was afraid to look at, yet could not look away from. And, indeed, even the lime-burner's dull and torpid sense began to be impressed by an indescribable something in that thin, rugged, thoughtful visage, with the grizzled hair hanging wildly about it, and those deeply-sunken eyes, which gleamed like fires within the entrance of a mysterious cavern. But, as he closed the door, the stranger turned towards him, and spoke in a quiet, familiar way, that made Bartram feel as if he were a sane and sensible man, after all.\n",
      ":Your task draws to an end, I see,\" said he. \"This marble has already been burning three days. A few hours more will convert the stone to lime.\"\n",
      "\"Why, who are you?\" exclaimed the lime-burner. \"You seem as well acquainted with my business as I am myself.\"\n",
      "\"And well I may be,\" said the stranger; \"for I followed the same craft many a long year, and here, too, on this very spot. But you are a newcomer in these parts. Did you never hear of Ethan Brand?\"\n",
      "\"The man that went in search of the Unpardonable Sin?\" asked Bartram, with a laugh.\n",
      "\"The same,\" answered the stranger. \"He has found what he sought, and therefore he comes back again.\"\n",
      "\"What! then you are Ethan Brand himself?\" cried the lime-burner, in amazement. \"I am a newcomer here, as you say, and they call it eighteen years since you left the foot of Gray-lock. But, I can tell you, the good folks still talk about Ethan Brand, in the village yonder, and what a strange errand took him away from his lime-kiln. Well, and so you have found the Unpardonable Sin?\"\n",
      "\"Even so!\" said the stranger, calmly.\n",
      "\"If the question is a fair one,\" proceeded Bartram, \"where might it be?\"\n",
      "Ethan Brand laid his finger on his own heart.\n",
      "\"Here!\" replied he.\n",
      "And then, without mirth in his countenance, but as if moved by an involuntary recognition of the infinite absurdity of seeking throughout the world for what was the closest of all things to himself, and looking into every heart, save his own, for what was hidden in no other breast, he broke into a laugh of scorn. It was the same slow, heavy laugh, that had almost appalled the lime-burner when it heralded the wayfarer's approach.\n",
      "The solitary mountain-side was made dismal by it. Laughter, when out of place, mistimed, or bursting forth from a disordered state of feeling, may be the most terrible modulation of the human voice. The laughter of one asleep, even if it be a little child--the madman's laugh--the wild, screaming laugh of a born idiot--are sounds that we sometimes tremble to hear, and would always willingly forget. Poets have imagined no utterance of fiends or hobgoblins so fearfully appropriate as a laugh. And even the obtuse lime-burner felt his nerves shaken, as this strange man looked inward at his own heart, and burst into laughter that rolled away into the night, and was indistinctly reverberated among the hills.\n",
      "\"Joe,\" said he to his little son, \"scamper down to the tavern in the village, and tell the jolly fellows there that Ethan Brand has come back, and that he has found the Unpardonable Sin!\"\n",
      "The boy darted away on his errand, to which Ethan Brand made no objection, nor seemed hardly to notice it. He sat on a log of wood, looking steadfastly at the iron door of the kiln. When the child was out of sight, and his swift and light footsteps ceased to be heard treading first on the fallen leaves and then on the rocky mountain path, the lime-burner began to regret his departure. He felt that the little fellow's presence had been a barrier between his guest and himself, and that he must now deal, heart to heart, with a man who, on his own confession, had committed the one only crime for which Heaven could afford no mercy. That crime, in its indistinct blackness, seemed to overshadow him. The lime-burner's own sins rose up within him, and made his memory riotous with a throng of evil shapes that asserted their kindred with the Master Sin, whatever it might be, which it was within the scope of man's corrupted nature to conceive and cherish. They were all of one family; they went to and fro between his breast and Ethan Brand's, and carried dark greetings from one to the other.\n",
      "Then Bartram remembered the stories which had grown traditionary in reference to this strange man, who had come upon him like a shadow of the night, and was making himself at home in his old place, after so long absence that the dead people, dead and buried for years, would have had more right to be at home, in any familiar spot, than he.\n",
      "Ethan Brand, it was said, had conversed with Satan himself in the lurid blaze of this very kiln. The legend had been matter of mirth heretofore but looked grisly now. According to this tale, before Ethan Brand departed on his search, he had been accustomed to evoke a fiend from the hot furnace of the lime-kiln, night after night, in order to confer with him about the Unpardonable Sin; the man and the fiend each laboring to frame the image of some mode of guilt which could neither be atoned for nor forgiven. And, with the first gleam of\n",
      "light upon the mountain-top, the fiend crept in at the iron door, there to abide the intensest element of fire, until again summoned forth to share in the dreadful task of extending man's possible guilt beyond the scope of Heaven's else infinite mercy.\n",
      "While the lime-burner was struggling with the horror of these thoughts, Ethan Brand rose from the log, and flung open the door of the kiln. The action was in such accordance with the idea in Bartram's mind, that he almost expected to see the Evil One issue forth, red-hot from the raging furnace.\n",
      "\"Hold! hold!\" cried he, with a tremulous attempt to laugh; for he was ashamed of his fears, although they overmastered him. \"Don't,\n",
      "for mercy's sake, bring out your devil now!\"\n",
      "\"Man!\" sternly replied Ethan Brand, \"what need have I of the devil? I have left him behind me, on my track. It is with such halfway sinners as you that he busies himself. Fear not because I open the door. I do but act by old custom, and am going to trim your fire, like a lime-burner, as I was once.\"\n",
      "He stirred the vast coals, thrust in more wood, and bent forward to gaze into the hollow prison-house of the fire, regardless of the fierce glow that reddened upon his face. The lime-burner sat watching him, and half suspected his strange guest of a purpose, if not to evoke a fiend, at least to plunge bodily into the flames, and thus vanish from the sight of man. Ethan Brand, however, drew quietly back, and closed the door of the kiln.\n",
      "\"I have looked,\" said he, \"into many a human heart that was seven times hotter with sinful passions than yonder furnace is with fire. But I found not there what I sought. No, not the Unpardonable Sin!\"\n",
      "\"What is the Unpardonable Sin?\" asked the lime-burner; and then he shrank further from his companion, trembling lest his question should be answered.\n",
      "\"It is a sin that grew within my own breast,\" replied Ethan Brand, standing erect, with a pride that distinguishes all enthusiasts of his stamp. \"A sin that grew nowhere else! The sin of an intellect that triumphed over the sense of brotherhood with man and reverence for God, and sacrificed everything to its own mighty claims! The only sin that deserves a recompense of immortal agony! Freely, were it to do again, would I incur the guilt. Unshrinkingly I accept the retribution!\"\n",
      "\"The man's head is turned,\" muttered the lime-burner to himself. \"He may be a sinner, like the rest of us--nothing more likely--but,\n",
      "I'll be sworn, he is a madman too.\"\n",
      "Nevertheless he felt uncomfortable at his situation, alone with Ethan Brand on the wild mountain-side, and was right glad to hear the rough murmur of tongues, and the footsteps of what seemed a pretty numerous party, stumbling over the stones and rustling through the underbrush. Soon appeared the whole lazy regiment that was wont to infest the village tavern comprehending three or four individuals who had drunk flip beside the bar-room fire through all the winters, and smoked their pipes beneath the stoop through all the summers, since Ethan Brand's departure. Laughing boisterously, and mingling all their voices together in unceremonious talk, they now burst into the moonshine and narrow streaks of fire-light that illuminated the open space before the lime-kiln. Bartram set the door ajar again, flooding the spot with light, that the whole company might get a fair view of Ethan Brand, and he of them.\n",
      "There, among other old acquaintances, was a once ubiquitous man,\n",
      "now almost extinct, but whom we were formerly sure to encounter at the hotel of every thriving village throughout the country. It was the stage-agent. The present specimen of the genus was a wilted and smoke-dried man, wrinkled and red-nosed, in a smartly cut, brown, bob-tailed coat, with brass buttons, who, for a length of time unknown, had kept his desk and corner in the bar-room, and was still puffing what seemed to be the same cigar that he had lighted twenty years before. He had great fame as a dry joker, though, perhaps, less on account of any intrinsic humor than from a certain flavor of brandy-toddy and tobacco-smoke, which impregnated all his ideas and expressions, as well as his person. Another well-remembered though strangely altered face was that of Lawyer Giles, as people still called him in courtesy; an elderly ragamuffin, in his soiled shirt-sleeves and tow-cloth trousers. This poor fellow had been an attorney, in what he called his better days, a sharp practitioner, and in great vogue among the village litigants; but flip, and sling, and\n",
      "toddy, and cocktails, imbibed at all hours, morning, noon, and night, had caused him to slide from intellectual to various kinds and degrees of bodily labor, till, at last, to adopt his own phrase, he slid into a soap-vat. In other words, Giles was now a soap-boiler, in a small way. He had come to be but the fragment of a human being, a part of one foot having been chopped off by an axe, and an entire hand torn away by the devilish grip of a steam-engine.\n",
      "Yet, though the corporeal hand was gone, a spiritual member remained; for, stretching forth the stump, Giles steadfastly averred that he felt an invisible thumb and fingers with as vivid a sensation as before the real ones were amputated. A maimed and miserable wretch he was; but one, nevertheless, whom the world could not trample on, and had no right to scorn, either in this or any previous stage of his misfortunes, since he had still kept up the\n",
      "courage and spirit of a man, asked nothing in charity, and with his one hand--and that the left one--fought a stern battle against want and hostile circumstances.\n",
      "Among the throng, too, came another personage, who, with certain points of similarity to Lawyer Giles, had many more of difference. It was the village doctor; a man of some fifty years, whom, at an earlier period of his life, we introduced as paying a professional visit to Ethan Brand during the latter's supposed insanity. He was now a purple-visaged, rude, and brutal, yet half-gentlemanly figure, with something wild, ruined, and desperate in his talk, and in all the details of his gesture and manners. Brandy possessed this man like an evil spirit, and made him as surly and savage as a wild beast, and as miserable as a lost soul; but there was supposed to be in him such wonderful skill, such native gifts of healing, beyond any which medical science could impart, that society caught hold of him, and would not let him sink out of its reach. So, swaying to and fro upon his horse, and grumbling thick accents at the bedside, he visited all the sick chambers for miles about among the mountain towns, and sometimes raised a dying man, as it were, by miracle, or quite as often, no doubt, sent his patient to a grave that was dug many a year too soon. The doctor had an everlasting pipe in his mouth, and, as somebody said, in allusion to his habit of swearing, it was always alight with hell-fire.\n",
      "These three worthies pressed forward, and greeted Ethan Brand each after his own fashion, earnestly inviting him to partake of the contents of a certain black bottle, in which, as they averred, he would find something far better worth seeking for than the Unpardonable Sin. No mind, which has wrought itself by intense and solitary meditation into a high state of enthusiasm, can endure the kind of contact with low and vulgar modes of thought and feeling to which Ethan Brand was now subjected. It made him doubt--and, strange to say, it was a painful doubt--whether he had indeed found the\n",
      "Unpardonable Sin, and found it within himself. The whole question on which he had exhausted life, and more than life, looked like a delusion.\n",
      "\"Leave me,\" he said, bitterly, \"ye brute beasts, that have made yourselves so, shrivelling up your souls with fiery liquors! I have done with you. Years and years ago, I groped into your hearts, and found nothing there for my purpose. Get ye gone!\"\n",
      "\"Why, you uncivil scoundrel,\" cried the fierce doctor, \"is that the way you respond to the kindness of your best friends? Then let me tell you the truth. You have no more found the Unpardonable Sin than yonder boy Joe has. You are but a crazy fellow--I told you so twenty years ago--neither better nor worse than a crazy fellow, and the fit companion of old Humphrey, here!\"\n",
      "He pointed to an old man, shabbily dressed, with long white hair, thin visage, and unsteady eyes. For some years past this aged person had been wandering about among the hills, inquiring of all travellers whom he met for his daughter. The girl, it seemed, had gone off with a company of circus-performers; and occasionally tidings of her came to the village, and fine stories were told of her glittering appearance as she rode on horse-back in the ring, or performed marvellous feats on the tight-rope.\n",
      "The white-haired father now approached Ethan Brand, and gazed unsteadily into his face.\n",
      "\"They tell me you have been all over the earth,\" said he, wringing his hands with earnestness. \"You must have seen my daughter, for she makes a grand figure in the world, and everybody goes to see her. Did she send any word to her old father, or say when she was coming back?\"\n",
      "Ethan Brand's eye quailed beneath the old man's. That daughter, from whom he so earnestly desired a word of greeting, was the Esther of our tale, the very girl whom, with such cold and remorseless purpose, Ethan Brand had made the subject of a psychological experiment, and wasted, absorbed, and perhaps annihilated her soul, in the process.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" murmured he, turning away from the hoary wanderer; \"it is no delusion. There is an Unpardonable Sin!\"\n",
      "While these things were passing, a merry scene was going forward in the area of cheerful light, beside the spring and before the door of the hut. A number of the youth of the village, young men and girls, had hurried up the hill-side, impelled by curiosity to see Ethan Brand, the hero of so many a legend familiar to their childhood. Finding nothing, however, very remarkable in his aspect--nothing but a sun-burnt wayfarer, in plain garb and dusty shoes, who sat looking into the fire, as if he fancied pictures among the coals--these young people speedily grew tired of observing him. As it happened,\n",
      "there was other amusement at hand. An old German Jew, travelling with a diorama on his back, was passing down the mountain-road towards the village just as the party turned aside from it, and, in hopes of eking out the profits of the day, the showman had kept them company to the lime-kiln.\n",
      "\"Come, old Dutchman,\" cried one of the young men, \"let us see your pictures, if you can swear they are worth looking at!\"\n",
      "\"O, yes, Captain,\" answered the Jew--whether as a matter of courtesy or craft, he styled everybody Captain--\"I shall show you, indeed, some very superb pictures!\"\n",
      "So, placing his box in a proper position, he invited the young men and girls to look through the glass orifices of the machine, and proceeded to exhibit a series of the most outrageous scratchings and daubings, as specimens of the fine arts, that ever an itinerant showman had the face to impose upon his circle of spectators. The pictures were worn out, moreover, tattered, full of cracks and wrinkles, dingy with tobacco-smoke, and otherwise in a most pitiable condition. Some purported to be cities, public edifices, and ruined castles in Europe; others represented Napoleon's battles and Nelson's sea-fights; and in the midst of these would be seen a gigantic, brown, hairy hand--which might have been mistaken for the Hand of Destiny, though, in truth, it was only the showman's--pointing its forefinger to various scenes of the conflict, while its owner gave historical illustrations. When, with much merriment at its\n",
      "abominable deficiency of merit, the exhibition was concluded, the German bade little Joe put his head into the box. Viewed through the magnifying glasses, the boy's round, rosy visage assumed the strangest imaginable aspect of an immense Titanic child, the mouth grinning broadly, and the eyes and every other feature overflowing with fun at the joke. Suddenly, however, that merry face turned pale, and its expression changed to horror, for this easily impressed and excitable child had become sensible that the eye of Ethan Brand was fixed upon him through the glass.\n",
      "\"You make the little man to be afraid, Captain,\" said the German Jew, turning up the dark and strong outline of his visage, from his stooping posture. \"But look again, and, by chance, I shall cause you to see somewhat that is very fine, upon my word!\"\n",
      "Ethan Brand gazed into the box for an instant, and then starting back, looked fixedly at the German. What had he seen? Nothing, apparently; for a curious youth, who had peeped in almost at the same moment, beheld only a vacant space of canvas.\n",
      "\"I remember you now,\" muttered Ethan Brand to the showman.\n",
      "\"Ah, Captain,\" whispered the Jew of Nuremberg, with a dark smile, \"I find it to be a heavy matter in my show-box--this Unpardonable Sin! By my faith, Captain, it has wearied my shoulders, this long day, to carry it over the mountain.\"\n",
      "\"Peace,\" answered Ethan Brand, sternly, \"or get thee into the furnace yonder!\"\n",
      "The Jew's exhibition had scarcely concluded, when a great, elderly dog--who seemed to be his own master, as no person in the company laid claim to him--saw fit to render himself the object of public notice. Hitherto, he had shown himself a very quiet, well disposed old dog, going round from one to another, and, by way of being sociable, offering his rough head to be patted by any kindly hand that would take so much trouble. But now, all of a sudden, this grave and venerable quadruped, of his own mere motion, and without the slightest suggestion from anybody else, began to run round after his tail, which, to heighten the absurdity of the proceeding, was a great deal shorter than it should have been. Never was seen such headlong eagerness in pursuit of an object that could not possibly be attained; never was heard such a tremendous outbreak of growling, snarling, barking, and snapping--as if one end of the ridiculous brute's body were at deadly and most unforgivable enmity with the other. Faster and faster, round about went the cur; and faster and still faster fled the unapproachable brevity of his tail; and louder and fiercer grew his yells of rage and animosity; until, utterly exhausted, and as far from the goal as ever, the foolish old dog ceased his performance as suddenly as he had begun it. The next moment\n",
      "he was as mild, quiet, sensible, and respectable in his deportment, as when he first scraped acquaintance with the company.\n",
      "As may be supposed, the exhibition was greeted with universal laughter, clapping of hands, and shouts of encore, to which the canine performer responded by wagging all that there was to wag of his tail, but appeared totally unable to repeat his very successful effort to amuse the spectators.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Ethan Brand had resumed his seat upon the log, and moved, it might be, by a perception of some remote analogy between his own case and that of this self-pursuing cur, he broke into the awful laugh, which, more than any other token, expressed the condition of his inward being. From that moment, the merriment of the party was at an end; they stood aghast, dreading lest the inauspicious sound should be reverberated around the horizon, and that mountain would thunder it to mountain, and so the horror be prolonged upon their ears. Then, whispering one to another that it was late--that the moon was almost down--that the August night was growing chill--they hurried homewards leaving the lime-burner and little Joe to deal as they might with their unwelcome guest. Save for these three human beings, the open space on the hill-side was a solitude, set in a vast gloom of forest. Beyond that darksome verge, the fire-light glimmered on the stately trunks and almost black foliage of pines, intermixed with the lighter verdure of sapling oaks, maples, and poplars, while here and there lay the gigantic corpses of dead trees, decaying on the leaf-strewn soil. And it seemed to little Joe--a timorous and imaginative child--that the silent forest was holding its breath, until some fearful thing should happen.\n",
      "Ethan Brand thrust more wood into the fire, and closed the door of the kiln; then looking over his shoulder at the lime-burner and his son, he bade, rather than advised, them to retire to rest.\n",
      "\"For myself, I cannot sleep,\" said he. \"I have matters that it concerns me to meditate upon. I will watch the fire, as I used to do in the old time.\"\n",
      "\"And call the devil out of the furnace to keep you company, I suppose,\" muttered Bartram, who had been making intimate acquaintance with the black bottle above-mentioned. \"But watch, if you like, and call as many devils as you like! For my part, I shall be all the better for a snooze. Come, Joe!\"\n",
      "As the boy followed his father into the hut, he looked back at the wayfarer, and the tears came into his eyes, for his tender spirit had an intuition of the bleak and terrible loneliness in which this man had enveloped himself.\n",
      "When they had gone, Ethan Brand sat listening to the crackling of the kindled wood, and looking at the little spirts of fire that issued through the chinks of the door. These trifles, however, once so familiar, had but the slightest hold of his attention, while deep within his mind he was reviewing the gradual but marvellous change that had been wrought upon him by the search to which he had devoted himself. He remembered how the night dew had fallen upon him--how the dark forest had whispered to him--how the stars had gleamed upon him--a simple and loving man, watching his fire in the years gone by, and ever musing as it burned. He remembered with what tenderness, with what love and sympathy for mankind, and what pity for human guilt and woe, he had first begun to contemplate those ideas which afterwards became the inspiration of his life; with what reverence he had then looked into the heart of man, viewing it as a temple originally divine, and, however desecrated, still to be held sacred by a brother; with what awful fear he had deprecated the success of his pursuit, and prayed that the Unpardonable Sin might never be revealed to him. Then ensued that vast intellectual development, which, in its progress, disturbed the counterpoise between his mind and heart. The Idea that possessed his life had operated as a means of education; it had gone on cultivating his powers to the highest point of which they were susceptible; it had raised him from the level of an unlettered laborer to stand on a star-lit eminence, whither the philosophers of the earth, laden with the lore of universities, might vainly strive to clamber after him. So much for the intellect! But where was the heart? That, indeed, had withered--had contracted--had hardened--had perished! It had ceased to partake of the universal throb. He had lost his hold of the magnetic chain of humanity. He was no longer a brother-man, opening the chambers or the dungeons of our common nature by the key of holy sympathy, which gave him a right to share in all its secrets; he was now a cold observer, looking on mankind as the subject of his experiment, and, at length, converting man and woman to be his puppets, and pulling the wires that moved them to such degrees of crime as were demanded for his study.\n",
      "Thus Ethan Brand became a fiend. He began to be so from the moment that his moral nature had ceased to keep the pace of improvement with his intellect. And now, as his highest effort and inevitable development--as the bright and gorgeous flower, and rich, delicious fruit of his life's labor--he had produced the Unpardonable Sin!\n",
      "What more have I to seek? What more to achieve?\" said Ethan Brand to himself. \"My task is done, and well done!\"\n",
      "Starting from the log with a certain alacrity in his gait, and ascending the hillock of earth that was raised against the stone circumference of the lime-kiln, he thus reached the top of the structure. It was a space of perhaps ten feet across, from edge to edge, presenting a view of the upper surface of the immense mass of broken marble with which the kiln was heaped. All these innumerable blocks and fragments of marble were red-hot and vividly on fire, sending up great spouts of blue flame, which quivered aloft and danced madly, as within a magic circle, and sank and rose again, with continual and multitudinous activity. As the lonely man bent forward over this terrible body of fire, the blasting heat smote up against his person with a breath that, it might be scorched and shrivelled him up in a moment.\n",
      "Ethan Brand stood erect, and raised his arms on high. The blue flames played upon his face, and imparted the wild and ghastly light which alone could have suited its expression; it was that of a fiend on the verge of plunging into his gulf of intensest torment.\n",
      "\"O Mother Earth,\" cried he, \"who art no more my Mother, and into whose bosom this frame shall never be resolved! O mankind, whose brotherhood I have cast off, and trampled thy great heart beneath my feet! O stars of heaven, that shone on me of old, as if to light me onward and upward!--farewell all, and forever. Come, deadly element of Fire--henceforth my familiar friend! Embrace me, as I do thee!\"\n",
      "That night the sound of a fearful peal of laughter rolled heavily through the sleep of the lime-burner and his little son; dim shapes of horror and anguish haunted their dreams, and seemed still present in the rude hovel, when they opened their eyes to the daylight.\n",
      "\"Up, boy, up!\" cried the lime-burner, staring about him. \"Thank Heaven, the night is gone, at last; and rather than pass such another, I would watch my lime-kiln, wide awake, for a twelvemonth. This Ethan Brand, with his humbug of an Unpardonable Sin, has done me no such mighty favor, in taking my place!\"\n",
      "He issued from the hut, followed by little Joe, who kept fast hold of his father's hand. The early sunshine was already pouring its gold upon the mountain-tops; and though the valleys were still in shadow, they smiled cheerfully in the promise of the bright day that was hastening onward. The village, completely shut in by hills, which swelled away gently about it, looked as if it had rested peacefully in the hollow of the great hand of Providence. Every dwelling was distinctly visible; the little spires of the two churches pointed upwards, and caught a fore-glimmering of brightness from the sun-gilt skies upon their gilded weather-cocks. The tavern was astir, and the figure of the old, smoke-dried stage-agent, cigar in mouth, was seen beneath the stoop. Old Graylock was glorified with a golden cloud upon his head. Scattered likewise over the breasts of the surrounding mountains, there were heaps of hoary mist, in fantastic shapes, some of them far down into the valley, others high up towards the summits and still others, of the same family of mist or cloud, hovering in the gold radiance of the upper atmosphere. Stepping from one to another of the clouds that rested on the hills, and thence to the loftier brotherhood that sailed in air, it seemed almost as if a mortal man might thus ascend into the heavenly regions. Earth was so mingled with sky that it was a day-dream to look at it.\n",
      "To supply that charm of the familiar and homely, which Nature so readily adopts into a scene like this, the stage-coach was rattling down the mountain-road, and the driver sounded his horn, while echo caught up the notes, and intertwined them into a rich and varied and elaborate harmony, of which the original performer could lay claim to little share. The great hills played a concert among themselves, each contributing a strain of airy sweetness.\n",
      "Little Joe's face brightened at once.\n",
      "\"Dear father,\" cried he, skipping cheerily to and fro, \"that strange man is gone, and the sky and the mountains all seem glad of it!\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" growled the lime-burner, with an oath, \"but he has let the fire go down, and no thanks to him if five hundred bushels of lime are not spoiled. If I catch the fellow hereabouts again, I shall feel like tossing him into the furnace!\"\n",
      "With his long pole in his hand, he ascended to the top of the kiln. After a moment's pause, he called to his son.\n",
      "\"Come up here, Joe!\" said he.\n",
      "So little Joe ran up the hillock, and stood by his father's side. The marble was all burnt into perfect, snow-white lime. But on its surface, in the midst of the circle--snow-white too, and thoroughly converted into lime--lay a human skeleton, in the attitude of a person who, after long toil, lies down to long repose. Within the ribs--strange to say--was the shape of a human heart.\n",
      "\"Was the fellow's heart made of marble?\" cried Bartram, in some perplexity at this phenomenon. \"At any rate, it is burnt into what looks like special good lime; and, taking all the bones together, my kiln is half a bushel the richer for him.\"\n",
      "So saying, the rude lime-burner lifted his pole, and, letting it fall upon the skeleton, the relics of Ethan Brand were crumbled into fragments.\n",

      "At nightfall, once in the olden time, on the rugged side of one of the Crystal Hills, a party of adventurers were refreshing themselves, after a toilsome and fruitless quest for the Great Carbuncle. They had come thither, not as friends nor partners in the enterprise, but each, save one youthful pair, impelled by his own selfish and solitary longing for this wondrous gem. Their feeling of brotherhood, however, was strong enough to induce them to contribute a mutual aid in building a rude hut of branches, and kindling a great fire of shattered pines, that had drifted down the headlong current of the Amonoosuck, on the lower bank of which they were to pass the night. There was but one of their number, perhaps, who had become so estranged from natural sympathies, by the absorbing spell of the pursuit, as to acknowledge no satisfaction at the sight of human faces, in the remote and solitary region whither they had ascended. A vast extent of wilderness lay between them and the nearest settlement, while a scant mile above their heads was that black verge where the hills throw off their shaggy mantle of forest trees, and either robe themselves in clouds or tower naked into the sky. The roar of the Amonoosuck would have been too awful for endurance if only a solitary man had listened, while the mountain stream talked with the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The adventurers, therefore, exchanged hospitable greetings, and welcomed one another to the hut, where each man was the host, and all were the guests of the whole company. They spread their individual supplies of food on the flat surface of a rock, and partook of a general repast; at the close of which, a sentiment of good fellowship was perceptible among the party, though repressed by the idea, that the renewed search for the Great Carbuncle must make them strangers again in the morning. Seven men and one young woman, they warmed themselves together at the fire, which extended its bright wall along the whole front of their wigwam. As they observed the various and contrasted figures that made up the assemblage, each man looking like a caricature of himself, in the unsteady light that flickered over him, they came mutually to the conclusion, that an odder society had never met, in city or wilderness, on mountain or plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eldest of the group, a tall, lean, weather-beaten man, some sixty years of age, was clad in the skins of wild animals, whose fashion of dress he did well to imitate, since the deer, the wolf, and the bear, had long been his most intimate companions. He was one of those ill-fated mortals, such as the Indians told of, whom, in their early youth, the Great Carbuncle smote with a peculiar madness, and became the passionate dream of their existence. All who visited that region knew him as the Seeker, and by no other name. As none could remember when he first took up the search, there went a fable in the valley of the Saco, that for his inordinate lust after the Great Carbuncle, he had been condemned to wander among the mountains till the end of time, still with the same feverish hopes at sunrise--the same despair at eve. Near this miserable Seeker sat a little elderly personage, wearing a high-crowned hat, shaped somewhat like a crucible. He was from beyond the sea, a Doctor Cacaphodel, who had wilted and dried himself into a mummy by continually stooping over charcoal furnaces, and inhaling unwholesome fumes during his researches in chemistry and alchemy. It was told of him, whether truly or not, that at the commencement of his studies, he had drained his body of all its richest blood, and wasted it, with other inestimable ingredients, in an unsuccessful experiment--and had never been a well man since. Another of the adventurers was Master Ichabod Pigsnort, a weighty merchant and selectman of Boston, and an elder of the famous Mr. Norton's church. His enemies had a ridiculous story that Master Pigsnort was accustomed to spend a whole hour after prayer time, every morning and evening, in wallowing naked among an immense quantity of pine-tree shillings, which were the earliest silver coinage of Massachusetts. The fourth whom we shall notice had no name that his companions knew of, and was chiefly distinguished by a sneer that always contorted his thin visage, and by a prodigious pair of spectacles, which were supposed to deform and discolor the whole face of nature, to this gentleman's perception. The fifth adventurer likewise lacked a name, which was the greater pity, as he appeared to be a poet. He was a bright-eyed man, but wofully pined away, which was no more than natural, if, as some people affirmed, his ordinary diet was fog, morning mist, and a slice of the densest cloud within his reach, sauced with moonshine, whenever he could get it. Certain it is, that the poetry which flowed from him had a smack of all these dainties The sixth of the party was a young man of haughty mien, and sat somewhat apart from the rest, wearing his plumed hat loftily among his elders, while the fire glittered on the rich embroidery of his dress, and gleamed intensely on the jewelled pommel of his sword. This was the Lord de Vere, who, when at home, was said to spend much of his time in the burial vault of his dead progenitors, rummaging their mouldy coffins in search of all the earthly pride and vainglory that was hidden among bones and dust; so that, besides his own share, he had the collected haughtiness of his whole line of ancestry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, there was a handsome youth in rustic garb, and by his side a blooming little person, in whom a delicate shade of maiden reserve was just melting into the rich glow of a young wife's affection. Her name was Hannah and her husband's Matthew; two homely names, yet well enough adapted to the simple pair, who seemed strangely out of place among the whimsical fraternity whose wits had been set agog by the Great Carbuncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beneath the shelter of one hut, in the bright blaze of the same fire, sat this varied group of adventurers, all so intent upon a single object, that, of whatever else they began to speak, their closing words were sure to be illuminated with the Great Carbuncle. Several related the circumstances that brought them thither. One had listened to a traveller's tale of this marvellous stone in his own distant country, and had immediately been seized with such a thirst for beholding it as could only be quenched in its intensest lustre. Another, so long ago as when the famous Captain Smith visited these coasts, had seen it blazing far at sea, and had felt no rest in all the intervening years till now that he took up the search. A third, being encamped on a hunting expedition full forty miles south of the White Mountains, awoke at midnight, and beheld the Great Carbuncle gleaming like a meteor, so that the shadows of the trees fell backward from it. They spoke of the innumerable attempts which had been made to reach the spot, and of the singular fatality which had hitherto withheld success from all adventurers, though it might seem so easy to follow to its source a light that overpowered the moon, and almost matched the sun. It was observable that each smiled scornfully at the madness of every other in anticipating better fortune than the past, yet nourished a scarcely hidden conviction that he would himself be the favored one. As if to allay their too sanguine hopes, they recurred to the Indian traditions that a spirit kept watch about the gem, and bewildered those who sought it either by removing it from peak to peak of the higher hills, or by calling up a mist from the enchanted lake over which it hung. But these tales were deemed unworthy of credit, all professing to believe that the search had been baffled by want of sagacity or perseverance in the adventurers, or such other causes as might naturally obstruct the passage to any given point among the intricacies of forest, valley, and mountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a pause of the conversation the wearer of the prodigious spectacles looked round upon the party, making each individual, in turn, the object of the sneer which invariably dwelt upon his countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So, fellow-pilgrims,\" said he, \"here we are, seven wise men, and one fair damsel--who, doubtless, is as wise as any graybeard of the company: here we are, I say, all bound on the same goodly enterprise. Methinks, now, it were not amiss that each of us declare what he proposes to do with the Great Carbuncle, provided he have the good hap to clutch it. What says our friend in the bear skin? How mean you, good sir, to enjoy the prize which you have been seeking, the Lord knows how long, among the Crystal Hills?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How enjoy it!\" exclaimed the aged Seeker, bitterly. \"I hope for no enjoyment from it; that folly has passed long ago! I keep up the search for this accursed stone because the vain ambition of my youth has become a fate upon me in old age. The pursuit alone is my strength,--the energy of my soul,--the warmth of my blood,--and the pith and marrow of my bones! Were I to turn my back upon it I should fall down dead on the hither side of the Notch, which is the gateway of this mountain region. Yet not to have my wasted lifetime back again would I give up my hopes of the Great Carbuncle! Having found it, I shall bear it to a certain cavern that I wot of, and there, grasping it in my arms, lie down and die, and keep it buried with me forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O wretch, regardless of the interests of science!\" cried Doctor Cacaphodel, with philosophic indignation. \"Thou art not worthy to behold, even from afar off, the lustre of this most precious gem that ever was concocted in the laboratory of Nature. Mine is the sole purpose for which a wise man may desire the possession of the Great Carbuncle. Immediately on obtaining it--for I have a presentiment, good people that the prize is reserved to crown my scientific reputation--I shall return to Europe, and employ my remaining years in reducing it to its first elements. A portion of the stone will I grind to impalpable powder; other parts shall be dissolved in acids, or whatever solvents will act upon so admirable a composition; and the remainder I design to melt in the crucible, or set on fire with the blow-pipe. By these various methods I shall gain an accurate analysis, and finally bestow the result of my labors upon the world in a folio volume.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excellent!\" quoth the man with the spectacles. \"Nor need you hesitate, learned sir, on account of the necessary destruction of the gem; since the perusal of your folio may teach every mother's son of us to concoct a Great Carbuncle of his own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, verily,\" said Master Ichabod Pigsnort, \"for mine own part I object to the making of these counterfeits, as being calculated to reduce the marketable value of the true gem. I tell ye frankly, sirs, I have an interest in keeping up the price. Here have I quitted my regular traffic, leaving my warehouse in the care of my clerks, and putting my credit to great hazard, and, furthermore, have put myself in peril of death or captivity by the accursed heathen savages--and all this without daring to ask the prayers of the congregation, because the quest for the Great Carbuncle is deemed little better than a traffic with the Evil One. Now think ye that I would have done this grievous wrong to my soul, body, reputation, and estate, without a reasonable chance of profit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not I, pious Master Pigsnort,\" said the man with the spectacles. \"I never laid such a great folly to thy charge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly, I hope not,\" said the merchant. \"Now, as touching this Great Carbuncle, I am free to own that I have never had a glimpse of it; but be it only the hundredth part so bright as people tell, it will surely outvalue the Great Mogul's best diamond, which he holds at an incalculable sum. Wherefore, I am minded to put the Great Carbuncle on shipboard, and voyage with it to England, France, Spain, Italy, or into Heathendom, if Providence should send me thither, and, in a word, dispose of the gem to the best bidder among the potentates of the earth, that he may place it among his crown jewels. If any of ye have a wiser plan, let him expound it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That have I, thou sordid man!\" exclaimed the poet. \"Dost thou desire nothing brighter than gold that thou wouldst transmute all this ethereal lustre into such dross as thou wallowest in already? For myself, hiding the jewel under my cloak, I shall hie me back to my attic chamber, in one of the darksome alleys of London. There, night and day, will I gaze upon it; my soul shall drink its radiance; it shall be diffused throughout my intellectual powers, and gleam brightly in every line of poesy that I indite. Thus, long ages after I am gone, the splendor of the Great Carbuncle will blaze around my name!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well said, Master Poet!\" cried he of the spectacles. \"Hide it under thy cloak, sayest thou? Why, it will gleam through the holes, and make thee look like a jack-o'-lantern!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To think!\" ejaculated the Lord de Vere, rather to himself than his companions, the best of whom he held utterly unworthy of his intercourse --\"to think that a fellow in a tattered cloak should talk of conveying the Great Carbuncle to a garret in Grub Street! Have not I resolved within myself that the whole earth contains no fitter ornament for the great hall of my ancestral castle? There shall it flame for ages, making a noonday of midnight, glittering on the suits of armor, the banners, and escutcheons, that hang around the wall, and keeping bright the memory of heroes. Wherefore have all other adventurers sought the prize in vain but that I might win it, and make it a symbol of the glories of our lofty line? And never, on the diadem of the White Mountains, did the Great Carbuncle hold a place half so honored as is reserved for it in the hall of the De Veres!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a noble thought,\" said the Cynic, with an obsequious sneer. \"Yet, might I presume to say so, the gem would make a rare sepulchral lamp, and would display the glories of your lordship's progenitors more truly in the ancestral vault than in the castle hall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, forsooth,\" observed Matthew, the young rustic, who sat hand in hand with his bride, \"the gentleman has bethought himself of a profitable use for this bright stone. Hannah here and I are seeking it for a like purpose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How, fellow!\" exclaimed his lordship, in surprise. \"What castle hall hast thou to hang it in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No castle,\" replied Matthew, \"but as neat a cottage as any within sight of the Crystal Hills. Ye must know, friends, that Hannah and I, being wedded the last week, have taken up the search of the Great Carbuncle, because we shall need its light in the long winter evenings; and it will be such a pretty thing to show the neighbors when they visit us. It will shine through the house so that we may pick up a pin in any corner and will set all the windows aglowing as if there were a great fire of pine knots in the chimney. And then how pleasant, when we awake in the night, to be able to see one another's faces!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a general smile among the adventurers at the simplicity of the young couple's project in regard to this wondrous and invaluable stone, with which the greatest monarch on earth might have been proud to adorn his palace. Especially the man with spectacles, who had sneered at all the company in turn, now twisted his visage into such an expression of ill-natured mirth, that Matthew asked him, rather peevishly, what he himself meant to do with the Great Carbuncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Great Carbuncle!\" answered the Cynic, with ineffable scorn. \"Why, you blockhead, there is no such thing in rerum natura. I have come three thousand miles, and am resolved to set my foot on every peak of these mountains, and poke my head into every chasm, for the sole purpose of demonstrating to the satisfaction of any man one whit less an ass than thyself that the Great Carbuncle is all a humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vain and foolish were the motives that had brought most of the adventurers to the Crystal Hills; but none so vain, so foolish, and so impious too, as that of the scoffer with the prodigious spectacles. He was one of those wretched and evil men whose yearnings are downward to the darkness, instead of heavenward, and who, could they but extinguish the lights which God hath kindled for us, would count the midnight gloom their chiefest glory. As the Cynic spoke, several of the party were startled by a gleam of red splendor, that showed the huge shapes of the surrounding mountains and the rock-bestrewn bed of the turbulent river with an illumination unlike that of their fire on the trunks and black boughs of the forest trees. They listened for the roll of thunder, but heard nothing, and were glad that the tempest came not near them. The stars, those dial points of heaven, now warned the adventurers to close their eyes on the blazing logs, and open them, in dreams, to the glow of the Great Carbuncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young married couple had taken their lodgings in the farthest corner of the wigwam, and were separated from the rest of the party by a curtain of curiously-woven twigs, such as might have hung, in deep festoons, around the bridal-bower of Eve. The modest little wife had wrought this piece of tapestry while the other guests were talking. She and her husband fell asleep with hands tenderly clasped, and awoke from visions of unearthly radiance to meet the more blessed light of one another's eyes. They awoke at the same instant, and with one happy smile beaming over their two faces, which grew brighter with their consciousness of the reality of life and love. But no sooner did she recollect where they were, than the bride peeped through the interstices of the leafy curtain, and saw that the outer room of the hut was deserted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Up, dear Matthew!\" cried she, in haste. \"The strange folk are all gone! Up, this very minute, or we shall lose the Great Carbuncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, so little did these poor young people deserve the mighty prize which had lured them thither, that they had slept peacefully all night, and till the summits of the hills were glittering with sunshine; while the other adventurers had tossed their limbs in feverish wakefulness, or dreamed of climbing precipices, and set off to realize their dreams with the earliest peep of dawn. But Matthew and Hannah, after their calm rest, were as light as two young deer, and merely stopped to say their prayers and wash themselves in a cold pool of the Amonoosuck, and then to taste a morsel of food, ere they turned their faces to the mountain-side. It was a sweet emblem of conjugal affection, as they toiled up the difficult ascent, gathering strength from the mutual aid which they afforded. After several little accidents, such as a torn robe, a lost shoe, and the entanglement of Hannah's hair in a bough, they reached the upper verge of the forest, and were now to pursue a more adventurous course. The innumerable trunks and heavy foliage of the trees had hitherto shut in their thoughts, which now shrank affrighted from the region of wind and cloud and naked rocks and desolate sunshine, that rose immeasurably above them. They gazed back at the obscure wilderness which they had traversed, and longed to be buried again in its depths rather than trust themselves to so vast and visible a solitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we go on?\" said Matthew, throwing his arm round Hannah's waist, both to protect her and to comfort his heart by drawing her close to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the little bride, simple as she was, had a woman's love of jewels, and could not forego the hope of possessing the very brightest in the world, in spite of the perils with which it must be won.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us climb a little higher,\" whispered she, yet tremulously, as she turned her face upward to the lonely sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" said Matthew, mustering his manly courage and drawing her along with him, for she became timid again the moment that he grew bold.\n",
      "\n",
      "And upward, accordingly, went the pilgrims of the Great Carbuncle, now treading upon the tops and thickly-interwoven branches of dwarf pines, which, by the growth of centuries, though mossy with age, had barely reached three feet in altitude. Next, they came to masses and fragments of naked rock heaped confusedly together, like a cairn reared by giants in memory of a giant chief. In this bleak realm of upper air nothing breathed, nothing grew; there was no life but what was concentrated in their two hearts; they had climbed so high that Nature herself seemed no longer to keep them company. She lingered beneath them, within the verge of the forest trees, and sent a farewell glance after her children as they strayed where her own green footprints had never been. But soon they were to be hidden from her eye Densely and dark the mists began to gather below, casting black spots of shadow on the vast landscape, and sailing heavily to one centre, as if the loftiest mountain peak had summoned a council of its kindred clouds. Finally, the vapors welded themselves, as it were, into a mass, presenting the appearance of a pavement over which the wanderers might have trodden, but where they would vainly have sought an avenue to the blessed earth which they had lost. And the lovers yearned to behold that green earth again, more intensely, alas! than, beneath a clouded sky, they had ever desired a glimpse of heaven. They even felt it a relief to their desolation when the mists, creeping gradually up the mountain, concealed its lonely peak, and thus annihilated, at least for them, the whole region of visible space. But they drew closer together, with a fond and melancholy gaze, dreading lest the universal cloud should snatch them from each other's sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, perhaps, they would have been resolute to climb as far and as high, between earth and heaven, as they could find foothold, if Hannah's strength had not begun to fail, and with that, her courage also. Her breath grew short. She refused to burden her husband with her weight, but often tottered against his side, and recovered herself each time by a feebler effort. At last, she sank down on one of the rocky steps of the acclivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are lost, dear Matthew,\" said she, mournfully. \"We shall never find our way to the earth again. And oh how happy we might have been in our cottage!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear heart!--we will yet be happy there,\" answered Matthew. \"Look! In this direction, the sunshine penetrates the dismal mist. By its aid, I can direct our course to the passage of the Notch. Let us go back, love, and dream no more of the Great Carbuncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The sun cannot be yonder,\" said Hannah, with despondence. \"By this time it must be noon. If there could ever be any sunshine here, it would come from above our heads.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But look!\" repeated Matthew, in a somewhat altered tone. \"It is brightening every moment. If not sunshine, what can it be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor could the young bride any longer deny that a radiance was breaking through the mist, and changing its dim hue to a dusky red, which continually grew more vivid, as if brilliant particles were interfused with the gloom. Now, also, the cloud began to roll away from the mountain, while, as it heavily withdrew, one object after another started out of its impenetrable obscurity into sight, with precisely the effect of a new creation, before the indistinctness of the old chaos had been completely swallowed up. As the process went on, they saw the gleaming of water close at their feet, and found themselves on the very border of a mountain lake, deep, bright, clear, and calmly beautiful, spreading from brim to brim of a basin that had been scooped out of the solid rock. A ray of glory flashed across its surface. The pilgrims looked whence it should proceed, but closed their eyes with a thrill of awful admiration, to exclude the fervid splendor that glowed from the brow of a cliff impending over the enchanted lake. For the simple pair had reached that lake of mystery, and found the longsought shrine of the Great Carbuncle!\n",
      "\n",
      "They threw their arms around each other, and trembled at their own success; for, as the legends of this wondrous gem rushed thick upon their memory, they felt themselves marked out by fate--and the consciousness was fearful. Often, from childhood upward, they had seen it shining like a distant star. And now that star was throwing its intensest lustre on their hearts. They seemed changed to one another's eyes, in the red brilliancy that flamed upon their cheeks, while it lent the same fire to the lake, the rocks, and sky, and to the mists which had rolled back before its power. But, with their next glance, they beheld an object that drew their attention even from the mighty stone. At the base of the cliff, directly beneath the Great Carbuncle, appeared the figure of a man, with his arms extended in the act of climbing, and his face turned upward, as if to drink the full gush of splendor. But he stirred not, no more than if changed to marble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the Seeker,\" whispered Hannah, convulsively grasping her husband's arm. \"Matthew, he is dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The joy of success has killed him,\" replied Matthew, trembling violently. \"Or, perhaps, the very light of the Great Carbuncle was death!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Great Carbuncle,\" cried a peevish voice behind them. \"The Great Humbug! If you have found it, prithee point it out to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned their heads, and there was the Cynic, with his prodigious spectacles set carefully on his nose, staring now at the lake, now at the rocks, now at the distant masses of vapor, now right at the Great Carbuncle itself, yet seemingly as unconscious of its light as if all the scattered clouds were condensed about his person. Though its radiance actually threw the shadow of the unbeliever at his own feet, as he turned his back upon the glorious jewel, he would not be convinced that there was the least glimmer there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is your Great Humbug?\" he repeated. \"I challenge you to make me see it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said Matthew, incensed at such perverse blindness, and turning the Cynic round towards the illuminated cliff. \"Take off those abominable spectacles, and you cannot help seeing it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now these colored spectacles probably darkened the Cynic's sight, in at least as great a degree as the smoked glasses through which people gaze at an eclipse. With resolute bravado, however, he snatched them from his nose, and fixed a bold stare full upon the ruddy blaze of the Great Carbuncle. But scarcely had he encountered it, when, with a deep, shuddering groan, he dropped his head, and pressed both hands across his miserable eyes. Thenceforth there was, in very truth, no light of the Great Carbuncle, nor any other light on earth, nor light of heaven itself, for the poor Cynic. So long accustomed to view all objects through a medium that deprived them of every glimpse of brightness, a single flash of so glorious a phenomenon, striking upon his naked vision, had blinded him forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Matthew,\" said Hannah, clinging to him, \"let us go hence!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Matthew saw that she was faint, and kneeling down, supported her in his arms, while he threw some of the thrillingly cold water of the enchanted lake upon her face and bosom. It revived her, but could not renovate her courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, dearest!\" cried Matthew, pressing her tremulous form to his breast,--\"we will go hence, and return to our humble cottage. The blessed sunshine and the quiet moonlight shall come through our window. We will kindle the cheerful glow of our hearth, at eventide, and be happy in its light. But never again will we desire more light than all the world may share with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said his bride, \"for how could we live by day, or sleep by night, in this awful blaze of the Great Carbuncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the hollow of their hands, they drank each a draught from the lake, which presented them its waters uncontaminated by an earthly lip. Then, lending their guidance to the blinded Cynic, who uttered not a word, and even stifled his groans in his own most wretched heart, they began to descend the mountain. Yet, as they left the shore, till then untrodden, of the spirit's lake, they threw a farewell glance towards the cliff, and beheld the vapors gathering in dense volumes, through which the gem burned duskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "As touching the other pilgrims of the Great Carbuncle, the legend goes on to tell, that the worshipful Master Ichabod Pigsnort soon gave up the quest as a desperate speculation, and wisely resolved to betake himself again to his warehouse, near the town dock, in Boston. But, as he passed through the Notch of the mountains, a war party of Indians captured our unlucky merchant, and carried him to Montreal, there holding him in bondage, till, by the payment of a heavy ransom, he had wofully subtracted from his hoard of pine-tree shillings. By his long absence, moreover, his affairs had become so disordered that, for the rest of his life, instead of wallowing in silver, he had seldom a sixpence worth of copper. Doctor Cacaphodel, the alchemist, returned to his laboratory with a prodigious fragment of granite, which he ground to powder, dissolved in acids, melted in the crucible, and burned with the blow-pipe, and published the result of his experiments in one of the heaviest folios of the day. And, for all these purposes, the gem itself could not have answered better than the granite. The poet, by a somewhat similar mistake, made prize of a great piece of ice, which he found in a sunless chasm of the mountains and swore that it corresponded, in all points, with his idea of the Great Carbuncle. The critics say, that, if his poetry lacked the splendor of the gem, it retained all the coldness of the ice. The Lord de Vere went back to his ancestral hall, where he contented himself with a wax-lighted chandelier, and filled, in due course of time, another coffin in the ancestral vault. As the funeral torches gleamed within that dark receptacle, there was no need of the Great Carbuncle to show the vanity of earthly pomp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cynic, having cast aside his spectacles, wandered about the world a miserable object, and was punished with an agonizing desire of light, for the wilful blindness of his former life. The whole night long, he would lift his splendor-blasted orbs to the moon and stars; he turned his face eastward, at sunrise, as duly as a Perisan idolater; he made a pilgrimage to Rome, to witness the magnificent illumination of St. Peter's Church; and finally perished in the great fire of London, into the midst of which he had thrust himself, with the desperate idea of catching one feeble ray from the blaze that was kindling earth and heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matthew and his bride spent many peaceful years, and were fond of telling the legend of the Great Carbuncle. The tale, however, towards the close of their lengthened lives, did not meet with the full credence that had been accorded to it by those who remembered the ancient lustre of the gem. For it is affirmed that, from the hour when two mortals had shown themselves so simply wise as to reject a jewel which would have dimmed all earthly things, its splendor waned. When other pilgrims reached the cliff, they found only an opaque stone, with particles of mica glittering on its surface. There is also a tradition that, as the youthful pair departed, the gem was loosened from the forehead of the cliff, and fell into the enchanted lake, and that, at noontide, the Seeker's form may still be seen to bend over its quenchless gleam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some few believe that this inestimable stone is blazing as of old, and say that they have caught its radiance, like a flash of summer lightning, far down the valley of the Saco. And be it owned that, many a mile from the Crystal Hills, I saw a wondrous light around their summits, and was lured, by the faith of poesy, to be the latest pilgrim of the Great Carbuncle.\n",

      "THE SEXTON stood in the porch of Milford meetinghouse, pulling busily at the bell rope. The old people of the village came stooping along the street. Children, with bright faces, tripped merrily beside their parents, or mimicked a graver gait, in the conscious dignity of their Sunday clothes. Spruce bachelors looked sidelong at the pretty maidens, and fancied that the Sabbath sunshine made them prettier than on weekdays. When the throng had mostly streamed into the porch, the sexton began to toll the bell, keeping his eye on the Reverend Mr. Hooper's door. The first glimpse of the clergyman's figure was the signal for the bell to cease its summons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what has good Parson Hooper got upon his face?\" cried the sexton in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "All within hearing immediately turned about, and beheld the semblance of Mr. Hooper, pacing slowly his meditative way toward the meetinghouse. With one accord they started, expressing more wonder than if some strange minister were coming to dust the cushions of Mr. Hooper's pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure it is our parson?\" inquired Goodman Gray of the sexton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of a certainty it is good Mr. Hooper,\" replied the sexton. \"He was to have exchanged pulpits with Parson Shute, of Westbury; but Parson Shute sent to excuse himself yesterday, being to preach a funeral sermon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The cause of so much amazement may appear sufficiently slight. Mr. Hooper gentlemanly person, of about thirty, though still a bachelor, was dressed with due clerical neatness, as if a careful wife had starched his band, and brushed the weekly dust from his Sunday's garb. There was but one thing remarkable in his appearance. Swathed about his forehead, and hanging down over his face, so low as to be shaken by his breath Mr. Hooper had on a black veil. On a nearer view it seemed to consist of two folds of crepe, which entirely concealed his features, except the mouth and chin, but probably did not intercept his sight, further than to\n",
      "give a darkened aspect to all living and inanimate things. With this gloomy shade before him, goad Mr. Hooper walked onward, at a slow and quiet pace, stooping somewhat, and looking on the ground, as is customary with abstracted men, yet nodding kindly to those of his parishioners who still waited on the meetinghouse steps. But so wonderstruck were they that his greeting hardly met with a return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't really feel as if good Mr. Hooper's face was behind that piece of crape,\" said the sexton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like it,\" muttered an old woman, as she hobbled into the meetinghouse. \"He has changed himself into something awful, only by hiding his face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our parson has gone mad!\" cried Goodman Gray, following him across the threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rumor of some unaccountable phenomenon had preceded Mr. Hooper into the meetinghouse, and set all the congregation astir. Few could refrain from twisting their heads toward the door; many stood upright, and turned directly about while several little boys clambered upon the seats, and came down again with a terrible racket. There was a general bustle, a rustling of the women's gowns and shuffling of the men's feet, greatly at variance with that hushed repose which should attend the entrance of the minister. But Mr. Hooper appeared not to notice the perturbation of his people. He entered with an almost noiseless step, bent his head mildly to the pews on each side, and bowed as he passed his oldest parishioner, a whitehaired great-grandsire, who occupied an armchair in the center of the aisle. It was strange to observe how slowly this venerable man became conscious of something singular in the appearance of his pastor. He seemed not fully to partake of the prevailing wonder, till Mr. Hooper had ascended the stairs, and showed himself in the pulpit, face to face with his congregation, except for the black veil. That mysterious emblem was never once withdrawn. It shook with his measured breath, as he gave out the psalm; it threw its obscurity between him and the holy page, as he read the Scriptures; and while he prayed, the veil lay heavily on his uplifted countenance. Did he seek to hide it from the dread Being whom he was addressing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the effect of this simple piece of crepe, that more than one woman of delicate nerves was forced to leave the meetinghouse. Yet perhaps the pale-faced congregation was almost as fearful a sight to the minister, as his black veil to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hooper had the reputation of a good preacher, but not an energetic one; he strove to win his people heavenward by mild, persuasive influences, rather than to drive them thither by the thunders of the Word. The sermon which he now delivered was marked by the same characteristics of style and manner as the general series of his pulpit oratory. But there was something, either in the sentiment of the discourse itself, or in the imagination of the auditors, which made it greatly the most powerful effort that they had ever heard from their pastor's lips. It was tinged, rather more darkly than usual, with the gentle gloom of Mr. Hooper's temperament. The subject had reference to secret sit, and those sad mysteries which we hide from our nearest and dearest and would fain conceal from our own consciousness, even forgetting that the Omniscient can de tect them. A subtle power was breathed into his words. Each member of the congregation, the most innocent girl, and the man of hardened breast, felt as if the preacher had crept upon them, behind his awful veil, and discovered their hoarded iniquity of deed or thought. Many spread their clasped hands on their bosoms. There was nothing terrible in what Mr. Hooper said, at least no violence; and yet, with every tremor of his melancholy voice, the hearers quaked. An unsought pathos came hand in hand with awe. So sensible were the audience of some unwonted attribute in their minister, that they longed for a breath of wind to blow aside the veil, almost believing that a stranger's visage would be discovered, though the form, gesture, and voice were those of Mr. Hooper.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the close of the services, the people hurried out with indecorous confusion, eager to communicate their pent-up amazement, and conscious of lighter spirits the  moment they lost sight of the black veil. Some gathered in little circles, huddled closely together, with their mouths all whispering in the center; some went homeward alone, wrapt in silent meditation; some talked loudly, and profaned the Sabbath day with ostentatious laughter. A few shook, their sagacious heads, intimating that they could penetrate the mystery; while one or two affirmed that there was no mystery at all, but only that Mr. Hooper's eyes were so weakened by the midnight lamp as to require a shade. After a brief interval, forth came good Mr. Hooper also, in the rear of his flock. Turning his veiled face from one group to another, he paid due reverence to the hoary heads, saluted the middle-aged with kind dignity as their friend and spiritual guide, greeted the young with mingled authority and love, and laid his hands on the little children's heads to bless them. Such was always his custom on the Sabbath day. Strange and bewildered looks repaid him for his courtesy. None, as on former occasions, aspired to the honor of walking by their pastor's side. Old Squire Saunders, doubtless by an accidental lapse of memory, neglected to invite Mr. Hooper to his table, where the good clergyman had been wont to bless the food, almost every Sunday since his settlement. He returned, therefore, to the parsonage, and, at the moment of closing the door, was observed to look back upon the people, all of whom had their eyes fixed upon the minister. A sad smile gleamed faintly from beneath the black veil, and flickered about his mouth, glimmering as he disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange,\" said a lady, \"that a simple black veil, such as any woman might wear on her bonnet, should become such a terrible thing on Mr. Hooper's face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something must surely be amiss with  Hooper's intellects,\" observed her husband, the physician of the village. \"But the strangest part of the affair is the effect of this vagary, even on a sober-minded man like myself. The black veil, though it covers only our pastor's face, throws its influence over his whole person, and makes him ghostlike from head to foot. Do you not feel it so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly do I,\" replied the lady; \"and I would not be alone with him for the world. I wonder he is not afraid to be alone with himself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Men sometimes are so,\" said her husband.\n",
      " \n",
      "The afternoon service was attended with similar circumstances. At its conclusion, the bell tolled for the funeral of a young lady. The relatives and friends were assembled in the house, and the more distant acquaintances stood about the door, speaking of the good qualities of the deceased, when their talk was interrupted by the appearance of Mr. Hooper, still covered with his black veil. It was now an appropriate emblem. The clergyman stepped into the room where the corpse was laid, and bent over the coffin, to take a last farewell of his deceased parishioner. As he stooped, the veil hung straight down from his forehead, so that, if her eyelids had not been dosed forever, the dead maiden might have seen his face. Could Mr. Hooper be fearful of her glance, that he so hastily caught back the black veil? A person who watched the interview between the dead and the living scrupled not to affirm, that, at the instant when the clergyman's features were disclosed, the corpse had slightly shuddered, rustling the shroud and muslin cap, though the countenance retained the composure of death. A superstitious old woman was the only witness of this prodigy. From the coffin Mr. Hooper passed into the chamber of the mourners, and thence to the head of the staircase, to make the funeral prayer. It was a tender and heart-dissolving prayer, full of sorrow, yet so imbued with celestial hopes, that the music of a heavenly harp, swept by the fingers of the dead, seemed faintly to be heard among the saddest accents of the minister. The people trembled, though they but darkly understood him when he prayed that they, and himself, and all of mortal race, might be ready, as he trusted this young maiden had been, for the dreadful hour that should snatch the veil from their faces. The bearers went heavily forth, and the mourners followed, saddening all the street, with the dead before them, and Mr. Hooper in his black veil behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do- you look back?\" said one in the procession to his partner. \"I had a fancy,\" replied she, \"that the minister and the maiden's spirit were walking hand in hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so had I, at the same moment,\" said the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, the handsomest couple in Milford village were to be joined in wedlock. Though reckoned a melancholy man, Mr. Hooper had a placid cheerfulness for such occasions, which often excited a sympathetic smile where livelier merriment would have been thrown away. There was no quality of his disposition which made him more beloved than this. The company at the wedding awaited his arrival with impatience, trusting that the strange awe, which had gathered over him throughout the day, would now be dispelled. But such was not the result. When Mr. Hooper came, the first thing that their eyes rested on was the same horrible black veil, which had added deeper gloom to the funeral, and could portend nothing but evil to the wedding. Such was its immediate effect on the guests that a cloud seemed to have rolled duskily from beneath the black crepe, and dimmed the light of the candles. The bridal pair stood up before the minister. But the bride's cold fingers quivered in the tremulous hand of the bridegroom, and her deathlike paleness caused a whisper that the maiden who had been buried a few hours before was come from her grave to be married. If ever another wedding were so dismal, it was that famous one where they tolled the wedding knell. After performing the ceremony, Mr. Hooper raised a glass of wine to his lips, wishing happiness to the new-married couple in a strain of mild pleasantry that ought to have brightened the features of the guests, like a cheerful gleam from the hearth. At that instant, catching a glimpse of his figure in the looking glass, the black veil involved his own spirit in the horror with which it overwhelmed all others. His frame shuddered his lips grew white, he spilt the untasted wine upon the carpet, and rushed forth into the darkness. For the Earth, too, had on her Black Veil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, the whole village of Milford talked of little else than Parson Hooper's black veil. That, and the mystery concealed behind it, supplied a topic for discussion between acquaintances meeting in the street, and good women gossiping at their open windows. It was the first item of news that the tavernkeeper told to his guests. The children babbled of it on their way to school. One imitative little imp covered his face with an old black handkerchief, thereby so affrighting his playmates that the panic seized himself, and he well-nigh lost his wits by his own waggery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was remarkable that of all the busybodies and impertinent people in the parish, not one ventured to put the plain question to Mr. Hooper, wherefore he did this thing. Hitherto, whenever there appeared the slightest call for such interference, he had never lacked advisers, nor shown himself averse to be guided by their judgment. If he erred at all, it was by so painful a degree of self-distrust, that even the mildest censure would lead him to consider an indifferent action as a crime. Yet, though so well acquainted with this amiable weakness, no individual among his parishioners chose to make the black veil a subject of friendly remonstrance. There was a feeling of dread, neither plainly confessed nor carefully concealed, which caused each to shift the responsibility upon another, till at length it was found expedient to send a deputation of the church, in order to deal with Mr. Hooper about the mystery, before it should grow into a scandal. Never did an embassy so ill discharge its duties. The minister received them with friendly courtesy, but remained silent, after they were seated, leaving to his visitors the whole burden of introducing their important business. The topic, it might be supposed, was obvious enough. There was the black veil swathed round Mr. Hooper's forehead, and concealing every feature above his placid mouth, on which, at times, they could perceive the glimmering of a melancholy smile. But that piece of crepe, to their imagination, seemed to hang down before his heart, the symbol of a fearful secret between him and them. Were the veil but cast aside, they might speak freely of it, but not till then. Thus they sat a considerable time, speechless, confused, and shrinking uneasily from Mr. Hooper's eye, which they felt to be fixed upon them with an invisible glance. Finally, the deputies returned abashed to their constituents, pronouncing the matter too weighty to be handled, except by a council of the churches, if, indeed, it might not require a general synod.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was one person in the village unappalled by the awe with which the black veil had impressed all besides herself. When the deputies returned without an explanation, or even venturing to demand one, she, with the calm energy of her character, determined to chase away the strange cloud that appeared to be settling round Mr. Hooper, every moment more darkly than before. As his plighted wife, it should be her privilege to know what the black veil concealed. At the minister's first visit, therefore, she entered upon the subject with a direct simplicity, which made the task easier both for him and her, After he had seated himself, she fixed her eyes steadfastly upon the veil, but could discern nothing of the dreadful gloom that had so overawed the multitude; it was but a double fold of crepe, hanging down from his forehead to his mouth, and slightly stirring with his breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said she aloud, and smiling, \"there is nothing terrible in this piece of crepe, except that it hides a face which I am always glad to look upon. Come, good sir, let the sun shine from behind the cloud. First lay aside your black veil; then tell me why you put it on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hooper's smile glimmered faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is an hour to come,\" said he, \"when all of us shall cast aside our veils. Take it not amiss, beloved friend, if I wear this piece of crepe till then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your words are a mystery, too,\" returned the young lady. \"Take away the veil from them, at least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Elizabeth, I will,\" said he, \"so far as my vow may suffer me. Know, then, this veil is a type and a symbol, and I am bound to wear it ever, both in light and darkness, in solitude and before the gaze of multitudes, and as with strangers, so with my familiar friends. No mortal eye will see it withdrawn. This dismal shade must separate me from the world; even you, Elizabeth, can never come behind it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What grievous affliction hath befallen you,\" she earnestly inquired, \"that you should thus darken your eyes forever?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it be a sign of mourning,\" replied Mr. Hooper, \"I, perhaps, like. most other mortals, have sorrows dark enough to be typified by a black veil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what if the world will not believe that it is the type of an innocent sorrow?\" urged Elizabeth. \"Beloved and respected: as you are, there may be whispers that you hide your face under the consciousness of secret sin. For the sake of your holy office, do away this scandal!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The color rose into her cheeks as she intimated the nature of the rumors that were already abroad in the village. But Mr. Hooper's mildness did not forsake him. He even smiled again--that same sad smile, which always appeared like a faint glimmering of light, proceeding from the obscurity beneath the veil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I hide my face for sorrow, there is cause enough;\" he merely replied; \"and if I cover it for secret sin, what mortal might not do the same?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with this gentle, but unconquerable obstinacy did he resist her entreaties. At length Elizabeth sat silent. For a few momeets she appeared lost in thought, considering, probably, what new methods might be tried to withdraw her foyer from so dark a fantasy, which, if it had no other meaning, was perhaps a symptom of mental disease. Though of a firmer character than his own, the tears rolled down her cheeks. But, in an instant, as it were, a new feeling took the place of sorrow; her eyes were fixed insensibly on the black veil, when, like a sudden twilight in the air, its terrors: fell around her. She arose, and stood trembling before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you feel it then, at last?\" said he, mournfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made no reply, but covered her eyes with her hand, and turned to leave the room. He rushed forward and caught her arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have patience with me, Elizabeth!\" cried he, passionately. \"Do not desert me, though this veil must be between us here on earth. Be mine, and hereafter there shall be no veil over my face, no darkness between our souls! It is but a mortal veil--it is not for eternity! O! you know not how lonely I am, and how frightened, to be alone behind my black veil. Do not leave me in this miserable obscurity forever!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lift the veil but once, and look me in the face,\" said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never! It cannot be!\" replied Mr. Hooper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then farewell!\" said Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She withdrew her arm from his grasp, and slowly departed, pausing at the door, to give one long shuddering gaze, that seemed almost to penetrate the mystery of the black veil. But, even amid his grief, Mr. Hooper smiled to think that only a material emblem had separated him from happiness, though the horrors which it shadowed forth must be drawn darkly between the fondest of lovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that time no attempts were made to remove Mr. Hooper's black veil, or, by a direct appeal, to discover the secret which it was supposed to hide. By persons who claimed a superiority to popular prejudice, it was reckoned more an eccentric whim, such as often mingles with the sober actions of men otherwise rational, and tinges them all with its own semblance of insanity. But with the multitude, good Mr. Hooper was irreparably a bugbear. He could not walk the street with any peace of mind, so conscious was he that the gentle and timid would turn aside to avoid him, and that others would make it a point of hardihood to throw themselves in his way. The impertinence of the latter class compelled him to give up his customary walk at sunset to the burial ground; for when he leaned pensively over the gate, there would always be faces behind the gravestones, peeping at his black veil. A fable went the rounds that the stare of the dead people drove him thence. It grieved him, to the very depth of his kind heart, to observe how the children fled from his approach, breaking up their merriest sports, while his melancholy figure was yet afar off. Their instinctive dread caused him to feel more strongly than aught else that a preternatural horror was interwoven with l the threads of the black crape. In truth, his own antipathy to the veil was known to be l so great, that he never willingly passed before a mirror, nor stooped to drink at a still fountain, lest, in its peaceful bosom, he should be affrighted by himself. This was what gave plausibility to the whispers, that Mr. Hooper's conscience tortured him for some great crime too horrible to be entirely concealed, or. Otherwise than so obscurely intimated. Thus, from beneath the black veil, there rolled a cloud into the sunshine, an ambiguity of sin or sorrow, which enveloped the poor minister, so that love or sympathy could never reach him. It was said that ghost and fiend consorted with him there. With self-shudderings and outward terrors, he walked continually in its l shadow, groping darkly within his own soul, or gazing through a medium that saddened the whole world. Even the lawless wind, it was believed, respected his dreadful secret, and never blew aside the veil. But still good Mr. Hooper sadly smiled at the pale visages of the worldly throng as he passed by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among all its bad influences, the black veil had the one desirable effect, of making its wearer a very efficient clergyman. By the aid of his mysterious emblem--for there was no other apparent cause--he became a man of awful power over souls that were in agony of sin. His converts always regarded him with a dread peculiar to themselves, affirming, though but figuratively, that, before he brought them to celestial light, they had been with him behind the black veil. Its gloom, indeed, enabled him to sympathize with all dark affections. Dying sinners cried aloud for Mr. Hooper, and would not yield their breath till he appeared; though ever, as he stooped to whisper consolation, they shuddered at the veiled face so near their own. Such were the terrors of the black veil, even when Death had bared his visage! Strangers came long distances to attend service at his church, with the mere idle purpose of gazing at his figure, because it was forbidden them to behold his face. But many were made to quake ere they departed! Once, during Governor Belcher's administration, Mr. Hooper was appointed to preach the election sermon. Covered with his black veil, he stood before the chief magistrate, the council, and the representatives, and wrought so deep an impression, that the legislative measures of that year were characterized by all the gloom and piety of our earliest ancestral sway.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner Mr. Hooper spent a long life, irreproachable in outward act, yet shrouded in dismal suspicions; kind and loving, though unloved, and dimly feared; a man apart from men, shunned in their health and joy, but ever summoned to their aid in mortal anguish. As years wore on, shedding their snows above his sable veil, he acquired a name throughout the New England churches, and they called him Father Hooper. Nearly all his parishioners, who were of mature age when he was settled, had been borne away by many a funeral; he had one congregation in the church, and a more crowded one in the churchyard; and having wrought so late into the evening, and done his work so well, it was now good Father Hooper's turn to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several persons were visible by the shaded candlelight, in the death chamber of the old clergyman. Natural connections he had none. But there was the decorously grave, though unmoved physician, seeking only to mitigate the last pangs of the patient whom he could not save. There were the deacons, and other eminently pious members of his church. There, also, was the Reverend Mr. Clark, of Westbury, a young and zealous divine, who had ridden in haste to pray by the bedside of the expiring minister. There was the nurse, no hired handmaiden of death, but one whose calm affection had endured thus long in secrecy, in solitude, amid the chill of age, and would not perish, even at the dying hour. Who, but Elizabeth! And there lay the hoary head of good Father Hooper upon the death pillow, with the black veil still swathed about his brow, and reaching down over his face, so that each more difficult gasp of his faint breath caused it to stir. All through life that piece of crepe had hung between him and the world; it had separated him from cheerful brotherhood and woman's love, arid kept him in that saddest of all prisons, his own heart; and still it lay upon his face, as if to deepen the gloom of his darksome chamber, and shade him from the sunshine of eternity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time previous, his mind had been confused, wavering doubtfully between the past and the present, and hovering forward, as it were, at intervals, into the indistinctness of the world to come. There had been feverish turns, which tossed him from side to side, and wore away what little strength he had. But in his most convulsive struggles, and in the wildest vagaries of his intellect, when no other thought retained its sober influence, he still showed an awful solicitude lest the black veil should slip aside. Even if his bewildered soul could have forgotten, there was a faithful woman at his pillow, who, with averted eyes, would have covered that aged face, which she had last beheld in the comeliness of manhood. At length the deathstricken old man lay quietly in the torpor of mental and bodily exhaustion, with an imperceptible pulse, and breath that grew fainter and fainter, except when a long, deep, and irregular inspiration seemed to prelude the flight of his spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minister of Westbury approached the bedside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Venerable Father Hooper,\" said he, \"the moment of your release is at hand. Are you ready for the lifting of the veil that shuts in time from eternity?\"  Father Hooper at first replied merely by a feeble motion of his head; then, apprehensive, perhaps, that his meaning might be doubtful, he exerted himself to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yea,\" said he, in faint accents, \"my soul hath a patient weariness until that veil be lifted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is it fitting,\" resumed the Reverend Mr. Clark, \"that a man so given to prayer, of such a blameless example, holy in deed and thought, so far as mortal judgment may pronounce; is it fitting that a father in the church should leave a shadow on his memory, that may seem to blacken a life so pure? I pray you, my venerable brother, let not this thing be! Suffer us to be gladdened by your triumphant aspect as you go to your reward. Before the veil of eternity be lifted, let me cast aside this black veil from your face!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus speaking the Reverend Mr. Clark bent forward to reveal the mystery of so many years. But, exerting a sudden energy, that made all the beholders stand aghast, Father Hooper snatched both his hands from beneath the bedclothes, and pressed them strongly on the black veil, resolute to struggle, if the minister of Westbury would contend with a dying man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never!\" cried the veiled clergyman. \"On earth, never!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dark old men!\" exclaimed the affrighted minister, \"with what horrible crime upon your soul are you now passing to the judgment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Father Hooper's breath heaved; it rattled in his throat; but, with a mighty effort, grasping forward with his hands, he caught hold of life, and held it back till he should speak, He even raised himself in bed; and there he sat, shivering with the arms of death around him, while the black veil hung down, awful, at that last moment, in the gathered terrors of a lifetime. And yet the faint, sad smile, so often there, now seemed to glimmer from its obscurity, and linger on Father Hooper's lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you tremble at me alone?\" cried he, turning his veiled face round the circle of pale spectators. \"Tremble also at each others Have men avoided me, and women shown no pity, and children screamed and fled, only for my black veil? What, but the mystery which it obscurely typifies, has made this piece of crepe so awful? When the friend shows his inmost heart to his friend; the lover to his best beloved; when man does not vainly shrink from the eye of his Creator, loathsomely treasuring up the secret of his sin; then deem me a monster, for the symbol beneath which I have lived, and die! I look around me, and, lo! on every visage a Black Veil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While his auditors shrank from one another, in mutual affright, Father Hooper fell back upon his pillow, a veiled corpse, with a faint smile lingering on the lips. Still veiled, they laid him in his coffin, and a veiled corpse they bore. him to the grave. The grass of many years has sprung up and withered on that grave, the burial stone is moss-grown, and good Mr. Hooper's face is dust; but awful is still the thought that it moldered beneath the Black Veil!\t\n",

      "We do not remember to have seen any translated specimens of the productions of M. de l'Aubepine--a fact the less to be wondered at, as his very name is unknown to many of his own countrymen as well as to the student of foreign literature. As a writer, he seems to occupy an unfortunate position between the Transcendentalists (who, under one name or another, have their share in all the current literature of the world) and the great body of pen-and-ink men who address the intellect and sympathies of the multitude. If not too refined, at all events too remote, too shadowy, and unsubstantial in his modes of development to suit the taste of the latter class, and yet too popular to satisfy the spiritual or metaphysical requisitions of the former, he must necessarily find himself without an audience, except here and there an individual or possibly an isolated clique. His writings, to do them justice, are not altogether destitute of fancy and originality; they might have won him greater reputation but for an inveterate love of allegory, which is apt to invest his plots and characters with the aspect of scenery and people in the clouds, and to steal away the human warmth out of his conceptions. His fictions are sometimes historical, sometimes of the present day, and sometimes, so far as can be discovered, have little or no reference either to time or space. In any case, he generally contents himself with a very slight embroidery of outward manners,--the faintest possible counterfeit of real life,--and endeavors to create an interest by some less obvious peculiarity of the subject. Occasionally a breath of Nature, a raindrop of pathos and tenderness, or a gleam of humor, will find its way into the midst of his fantastic imagery, and make us feel as if, after all, we were yet within the limits of our native earth. We will only add to this very cursory notice that M. de l'Aubepine's productions, if the reader chance to take them in precisely the proper point of view, may amuse a leisure hour as well as those of a brighter man; if otherwise, they can hardly fail to look excessively like nonsense.\n",

      "Our author is voluminous; he continues to write and publish with as much praiseworthy and indefatigable prolixity as if his efforts were crowned with the brilliant success that so justly attends those of Eugene Sue. His first appearance was by a collection of stories in a long series of volumes entitled \"Contes deux fois racontees.\" The titles of some of his more recent works (we quote from memory) are as follows: \"Le Voyage Celeste a Chemin de Fer,\" 3 tom., 1838; \"Le nouveau Pere Adam et la nouvelle Mere Eve,\" 2 tom., 1839; \"Roderic; ou le Serpent a l'estomac,\" 2 tom., 1840; \"Le Culte du Feu,\" a folio volume of ponderous research into the religion and ritual of the old Persian Ghebers, published in 1841; \"La Soiree du Chateau en Espagne,\" 1 tom., 8vo, 1842; and \"L'Artiste du Beau; ou le Papillon Mecanique,\" 5 tom., 4to, 1843. Our somewhat wearisome perusal of this startling catalogue of volumes has left behind it a certain personal affection and sympathy, though by no means admiration, for M. de l'Aubepine; and we would fain do the little in our power towards introducing him favorably to the American public. The ensuing tale is a translation of his \"Beatrice; ou la Belle Empoisonneuse,\" recently published in \"La Revue Anti-Aristocratique.\" This journal, edited by the Comte de Bearhaven, has for some years past led the defence of liberal principles and popular rights with a faithfulness and ability worthy of all praise.\n",

      "A young man, named Giovanni Guasconti, came, very long ago, from the more southern region of Italy, to pursue his studies at the University of Padua. Giovanni, who had but a scanty supply of gold ducats in his pocket, took lodgings in a high and gloomy chamber of an old edifice which looked not unworthy to have been the palace of a Paduan noble, and which, in fact, exhibited over its entrance the armorial bearings of a family long since extinct. The young stranger, who was not unstudied in the great poem of his country, recollected that one of the ancestors of this family, and perhaps an occupant of this very mansion, had been pictured by Dante as a partaker of the immortal agonies of his Inferno. These reminiscences and associations, together with the tendency to heartbreak natural to a young man for the first time out of his native sphere, caused Giovanni to sigh heavily as he looked around the desolate and ill-furnished apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Holy Virgin, signor!\" cried old Dame Lisabetta, who, won by the youth's remarkable beauty of person, was kindly endeavoring to give the chamber a habitable air, \"what a sigh was that to come out of a young man's heart! Do you find this old mansion gloomy? For the love of Heaven, then, put your head out of the window, and you will see as bright sunshine as you have left in Naples.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Guasconti mechanically did as the old woman advised, but could not quite agree with her that the Paduan sunshine was as cheerful as that of southern Italy. Such as it was, however, it fell upon a garden beneath the window and expended its fostering influences on a variety of plants, which seemed to have been cultivated with exceeding care.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does this garden belong to the house?\" asked Giovanni.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven forbid, signor, unless it were fruitful of better pot herbs than any that grow there now,\" answered old Lisabetta. \"No; that garden is cultivated by the own hands of Signor Giacomo Rappaccini, the famous doctor, who, I warrant him, has been heard of as far as Naples. It is said that he distils these plants into medicines that are as potent as a charm. Oftentimes you may see the signor doctor at work, and perchance the signora, his daughter, too, gathering the strange flowers that grow in the garden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman had now done what she could for the aspect of the chamber; and, commending the young man to the protection of the saints, took her departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giovanni still found no better occupation than to look down into the garden beneath his window. From its appearance, he judged it to be one of those botanic gardens which were of earlier date in Padua than elsewhere in Italy or in the world. Or, not improbably, it might once have been the pleasure-place of an opulent family; for there was the ruin of a marble fountain in the centre, sculptured with rare art, but so wofully shattered that it was impossible to trace the original design from the chaos of remaining fragments. The water, however, continued to gush and sparkle into the sunbeams as cheerfully as ever. A little gurgling sound ascended to the young man's window, and made him feel as if the fountain were an immortal spirit that sung its song unceasingly and without heeding the vicissitudes around it, while one century imbodied it in marble and another scattered the perishable garniture on the soil. All about the pool into which the water subsided grew various plants, that seemed to require a plentiful supply of moisture for the nourishment of gigantic leaves, and in some instances, flowers gorgeously magnificent. There was one shrub in particular, set in a marble vase in the midst of the pool, that bore a profusion of purple blossoms, each of which had the lustre and richness of a gem; and the whole together made a show so resplendent that it seemed enough to illuminate the garden, even had there been no sunshine. Every portion of the soil was peopled with plants and herbs, which, if less beautiful, still bore tokens of assiduous care, as if all had their individual virtues, known to the scientific mind that fostered them. Some were placed in urns, rich with old carving, and others in common garden pots; some crept serpent-like along the ground or climbed on high, using whatever means of ascent was offered them. One plant had wreathed itself round a statue of Vertumnus, which was thus quite veiled and shrouded in a drapery of hanging foliage, so happily arranged that it might have served a sculptor for a study.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Giovanni stood at the window he heard a rustling behind a screen of leaves, and became aware that a person was at work in the garden. His figure soon emerged into view, and showed itself to be that of no common laborer, but a tall, emaciated, sallow, and sickly-looking man, dressed in a scholar's garb of black. He was beyond the middle term of life, with gray hair, a thin, gray beard, and a face singularly marked with intellect and cultivation, but which could never, even in his more youthful days, have expressed much warmth of heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could exceed the intentness with which this scientific gardener examined every shrub which grew in his path: it seemed as if he was looking into their inmost nature, making observations in regard to their creative essence, and discovering why one leaf grew in this shape and another in that, and wherefore such and such flowers differed among themselves in hue and perfume. Nevertheless, in spite of this deep intelligence on his part, there was no approach to intimacy between himself and these vegetable existences. On the contrary, he avoided their actual touch or the direct inhaling of their odors with a caution that impressed Giovanni most disagreeably; for the man's demeanor was that of one walking among malignant influences, such as savage beasts, or deadly snakes, or evil spirits, which, should he allow them one moment of license, would wreak upon him some terrible fatality. It was strangely frightful to the young man's imagination to see this air of insecurity in a person cultivating a garden, that most simple and innocent of human toils, and which had been alike the joy and labor of the unfallen parents of the race. Was this garden, then, the Eden of the present world? And this man, with such a perception of harm in what his own hands caused to grow,--was he the Adam?\n",
      "\n",
      "The distrustful gardener, while plucking away the dead leaves or pruning the too luxuriant growth of the shrubs, defended his hands with a pair of thick gloves. Nor were these his only armor. When, in his walk through the garden, he came to the magnificent plant that hung its purple gems beside the marble fountain, he placed a kind of mask over his mouth and nostrils, as if all this beauty did but conceal a deadlier malice; but, finding his task still too dangerous, he drew back, removed the mask, and called loudly, but in the infirm voice of a person affected with inward disease, \"Beatrice! Beatrice!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here am I, my father. What would you?\" cried a rich and youthful voice from the window of the opposite house--a voice as rich as a tropical sunset, and which made Giovanni, though he knew not why, think of deep hues of purple or crimson and of perfumes heavily delectable. \"Are you in the garden?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Beatrice,\" answered the gardener, \"and I need your help.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon there emerged from under a sculptured portal the figure of a young girl, arrayed with as much richness of taste as the most splendid of the flowers, beautiful as the day, and with a bloom so deep and vivid that one shade more would have been too much. She looked redundant with life, health, and energy; all of which attributes were bound down and compressed, as it were and girdled tensely, in their luxuriance, by her virgin zone. Yet Giovanni's fancy must have grown morbid while he looked down into the garden; for the impression which the fair stranger made upon him was as if here were another flower, the human sister of those vegetable ones, as beautiful as they, more beautiful than the richest of them, but still to be touched only with a glove, nor to be approached without a mask. As Beatrice came down the garden path, it was observable that she handled and inhaled the odor of several of the plants which her father had most sedulously avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, Beatrice,\" said the latter, \"see how many needful offices require to be done to our chief treasure. Yet, shattered as I am, my life might pay the penalty of approaching it so closely as circumstances demand. Henceforth, I fear, this plant must be consigned to your sole charge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And gladly will I undertake it,\" cried again the rich tones of the young lady, as she bent towards the magnificent plant and opened her arms as if to embrace it. \"Yes, my sister, my splendour, it shall be Beatrice's task to nurse and serve thee; and thou shalt reward her with thy kisses and perfumed breath, which to her is as the breath of life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, with all the tenderness in her manner that was so strikingly expressed in her words, she busied herself with such attentions as the plant seemed to require; and Giovanni, at his lofty window, rubbed his eyes and almost doubted whether it were a girl tending her favorite flower, or one sister performing the duties of affection to another. The scene soon terminated. Whether Dr. Rappaccini had finished his labors in the garden, or that his watchful eye had caught the stranger's face, he now took his daughter's arm and retired. Night was already closing in; oppressive exhalations seemed to proceed from the plants and steal upward past the open window; and Giovanni, closing the lattice, went to his couch and dreamed of a rich flower and beautiful girl. Flower and maiden were different, and yet the same, and fraught with some strange peril in either shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is an influence in the light of morning that tends to rectify whatever errors of fancy, or even of judgment, we may have incurred during the sun's decline, or among the shadows of the night, or in the less wholesome glow of moonshine. Giovanni's first movement, on starting from sleep, was to throw open the window and gaze down into the garden which his dreams had made so fertile of mysteries. He was surprised and a little ashamed to find how real and matter-of-fact an affair it proved to be, in the first rays of the sun which gilded the dew-drops that hung upon leaf and blossom, and, while giving a brighter beauty to each rare flower, brought everything within the limits of ordinary experience. The young man rejoiced that, in the heart of the barren city, he had the privilege of overlooking this spot of lovely and luxuriant vegetation. It would serve, he said to himself, as a symbolic language to keep him in communion with Nature. Neither the sickly and thoughtworn Dr. Giacomo Rappaccini, it is true, nor his brilliant daughter, were now visible; so that Giovanni could not determine how much of the singularity which he attributed to both was due to their own qualities and how much to his wonder-working fancy; but he was inclined to take a most rational view of the whole matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of the day he paid his respects to Signor Pietro Baglioni, professor of medicine in the university, a physician of eminent repute to whom Giovanni had brought a letter of introduction. The professor was an elderly personage, apparently of genial nature, and habits that might almost be called jovial. He kept the young man to dinner, and made himself very agreeable by the freedom and liveliness of his conversation, especially when warmed by a flask or two of Tuscan wine. Giovanni, conceiving that men of science, inhabitants of the same city, must needs be on familiar terms with one another, took an opportunity to mention the name of Dr. Rappaccini. But the professor did not respond with so much cordiality as he had anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ill would it become a teacher of the divine art of medicine,\" said Professor Pietro Baglioni, in answer to a question of Giovanni, \"to withhold due and well-considered praise of a physician so eminently skilled as Rappaccini; but, on the other hand, I should answer it but scantily to my conscience were I to permit a worthy youth like yourself, Signor Giovanni, the son of an ancient friend, to imbibe erroneous ideas respecting a man who might hereafter chance to hold your life and death in his hands. The truth is, our worshipful Dr. Rappaccini has as much science as any member of the faculty--with perhaps one single exception--in Padua, or all Italy; but there are certain grave objections to his professional character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what are they?\" asked the young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has my friend Giovanni any disease of body or heart, that he is so inquisitive about physicians?\" said the professor, with a smile. \"But as for Rappaccini, it is said of him--and I, who know the man well, can answer for its truth--that he cares infinitely more for science than for mankind. His patients are interesting to him only as subjects for some new experiment. He would sacrifice human life, his own among the rest, or whatever else was dearest to him, for the sake of adding so much as a grain of mustard seed to the great heap of his accumulated knowledge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Methinks he is an awful man indeed,\" remarked Guasconti, mentally recalling the cold and purely intellectual aspect of Rappaccini. \"And yet, worshipful professor, is it not a noble spirit? Are there many men capable of so spiritual a love of science?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God forbid,\" answered the professor, somewhat testily; \"at least, unless they take sounder views of the healing art than those adopted by Rappaccini. It is his theory that all medicinal virtues are comprised within those substances which we term vegetable poisons. These he cultivates with his own hands, and is said even to have produced new varieties of poison, more horribly deleterious than Nature, without the assistance of this learned person, would ever have plagued the world withal. That the signor doctor does less mischief than might be expected with such dangerous substances is undeniable. Now and then, it must be owned, he has effected, or seemed to effect, a marvellous cure; but, to tell you my private mind, Signor Giovanni, he should receive little credit for such instances of success,--they being probably the work of chance, --but should be held strictly accountable for his failures, which may justly be considered his own work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth might have taken Baglioni's opinions with many grains of allowance had he known that there was a professional warfare of long continuance between him and Dr. Rappaccini, in which the latter was generally thought to have gained the advantage. If the reader be inclined to judge for himself, we refer him to certain black-letter tracts on both sides, preserved in the medical department of the University of Padua.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know not, most learned professor,\" returned Giovanni, after musing on what had been said of Rappaccini's exclusive zeal for science,--\"I know not how dearly this physician may love his art; but surely there is one object more dear to him. He has a daughter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha!\" cried the professor, with a laugh. \"So now our friend Giovanni's secret is out. You have heard of this daughter, whom all the young men in Padua are wild about, though not half a dozen have ever had the good hap to see her face. I know little of the Signora Beatrice save that Rappaccini is said to have instructed her deeply in his science, and that, young and beautiful as fame reports her, she is already qualified to fill a professor's chair. Perchance her father destines her for mine! Other absurd rumors there be, not worth talking about or listening to. So now, Signor Giovanni, drink off your glass of lachryma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Guasconti returned to his lodgings somewhat heated with the wine he had quaffed, and which caused his brain to swim with strange fantasies in reference to Dr. Rappaccini and the beautiful Beatrice. On his way, happening to pass by a florist's, he bought a fresh bouquet of flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ascending to his chamber, he seated himself near the window, but within the shadow thrown by the depth of the wall, so that he could look down into the garden with little risk of being discovered. All beneath his eye was a solitude. The strange plants were basking in the sunshine, and now and then nodding gently to one another, as if in acknowledgment of sympathy and kindred. In the midst, by the shattered fountain, grew the magnificent shrub, with its purple gems clustering all over it; they glowed in the air, and gleamed back again out of the depths of the pool, which thus seemed to overflow with colored radiance from the rich reflection that was steeped in it. At first, as we have said, the garden was a solitude. Soon, however,--as Giovanni had half hoped, half feared, would be the case,--a figure appeared beneath the antique sculptured portal, and came down between the rows of plants, inhaling their various perfumes as if she were one of those beings of old classic fable that lived upon sweet odors. On again beholding Beatrice, the young man was even startled to perceive how much her beauty exceeded his recollection of it; so brilliant, so vivid, was its character, that she glowed amid the sunlight, and, as Giovanni whispered to himself, positively illuminated the more shadowy intervals of the garden path. Her face being now more revealed than on the former occasion, he was struck by its expression of simplicity and sweetness,--qualities that had not entered into his idea of her character, and which made him ask anew what manner of mortal she might be. Nor did he fail again to observe, or imagine, an analogy between the beautiful girl and the gorgeous shrub that hung its gemlike flowers over the fountain,--a resemblance which Beatrice seemed to have indulged a fantastic humor in heightening, both by the arrangement of her dress and the selection of its hues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approaching the shrub, she threw open her arms, as with a passionate ardor, and drew its branches into an intimate embrace--so intimate that her features were hidden in its leafy bosom and her glistening ringlets all intermingled with the flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me thy breath, my sister,\" exclaimed Beatrice; \"for I am faint with common air. And give me this flower of thine, which I separate with gentlest fingers from the stem and place it close beside my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With these words the beautiful daughter of Rappaccini plucked one of the richest blossoms of the shrub, and was about to fasten it in her bosom. But now, unless Giovanni's draughts of wine had bewildered his senses, a singular incident occurred. A small orange-colored reptile, of the lizard or chameleon species, chanced to be creeping along the path, just at the feet of Beatrice. It appeared to Giovanni,--but, at the distance from which he gazed, he could scarcely have seen anything so minute,--it appeared to him, however, that a drop or two of moisture from the broken stem of the flower descended upon the lizard's head. For an instant the reptile contorted itself violently, and then lay motionless in the sunshine. Beatrice observed this remarkable phenomenon and crossed herself, sadly, but without surprise; nor did she therefore hesitate to arrange the fatal flower in her bosom. There it blushed, and almost glimmered with the dazzling effect of a precious stone, adding to her dress and aspect the one appropriate charm which nothing else in the world could have supplied. But Giovanni, out of the shadow of his window, bent forward and shrank back, and murmured and trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I awake? Have I my senses?\" said he to himself. \"What is this being? Beautiful shall I call her, or inexpressibly terrible?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beatrice now strayed carelessly through the garden, approaching closer beneath Giovanni's window, so that he was compelled to thrust his head quite out of its concealment in order to gratify the intense and painful curiosity which she excited. At this moment there came a beautiful insect over the garden wall; it had, perhaps, wandered through the city, and found no flowers or verdure among those antique haunts of men until the heavy perfumes of Dr. Rappaccini's shrubs had lured it from afar. Without alighting on the flowers, this winged brightness seemed to be attracted by Beatrice, and lingered in the air and fluttered about her head. Now, here it could not be but that Giovanni Guasconti's eyes deceived him. Be that as it might, he fancied that, while Beatrice was gazing at the insect with childish delight, it grew faint and fell at her feet; its bright wings shivered; it was dead--from no cause that he could discern, unless it were the atmosphere of her breath. Again Beatrice crossed herself and sighed heavily as she bent over the dead insect.\n",
      "\n",
      "An impulsive movement of Giovanni drew her eyes to the window. There she beheld the beautiful head of the young man--rather a Grecian than an Italian head, with fair, regular features, and a glistening of gold among his ringlets--gazing down upon her like a being that hovered in mid air. Scarcely knowing what he did, Giovanni threw down the bouquet which he had hitherto held in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Signora,\" said he, \"there are pure and healthful flowers. Wear them for the sake of Giovanni Guasconti.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks, signor,\" replied Beatrice, with her rich voice, that came forth as it were like a gush of music, and with a mirthful expression half childish and half woman-like. \"I accept your gift, and would fain recompense it with this precious purple flower; but if I toss it into the air it will not reach you. So Signor Guasconti must even content himself with my thanks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She lifted the bouquet from the ground, and then, as if inwardly ashamed at having stepped aside from her maidenly reserve to respond to a stranger's greeting, passed swiftly homeward through the garden. But few as the moments were, it seemed to Giovanni, when she was on the point of vanishing beneath the sculptured portal, that his beautiful bouquet was already beginning to wither in her grasp. It was an idle thought; there could be no possibility of distinguishing a faded flower from a fresh one at so great a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many days after this incident the young man avoided the window that looked into Dr. Rappaccini's garden, as if something ugly and monstrous would have blasted his eyesight had he been betrayed into a glance. He felt conscious of having put himself, to a certain extent, within the influence of an unintelligible power by the communication which he had opened with Beatrice. The wisest course would have been, if his heart were in any real danger, to quit his lodgings and Padua itself at once; the next wiser, to have accustomed himself, as far as possible, to the familiar and daylight view of Beatrice--thus bringing her rigidly and systematically within the limits of ordinary experience. Least of all, while avoiding her sight, ought Giovanni to have remained so near this extraordinary being that the proximity and possibility even of intercourse should give a kind of substance and reality to the wild vagaries which his imagination ran riot continually in producing. Guasconti had not a deep heart--or, at all events, its depths were not sounded now; but he had a quick fancy, and an ardent southern temperament, which rose every instant to a higher fever pitch. Whether or no Beatrice possessed those terrible attributes, that fatal breath, the affinity with those so beautiful and deadly flowers which were indicated by what Giovanni had witnessed, she had at least instilled a fierce and subtle poison into his system. It was not love, although her rich beauty was a madness to him; nor horror, even while he fancied her spirit to be imbued with the same baneful essence that seemed to pervade her physical frame; but a wild offspring of both love and horror that had each parent in it, and burned like one and shivered like the other. Giovanni knew not what to dread; still less did he know what to hope; yet hope and dread kept a continual warfare in his breast, alternately vanquishing one another and starting up afresh to renew the contest. Blessed are all simple emotions, be they dark or bright! It is the lurid intermixture of the two that produces the illuminating blaze of the infernal regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes he endeavored to assuage the fever of his spirit by a rapid walk through the streets of Padua or beyond its gates: his footsteps kept time with the throbbings of his brain, so that the walk was apt to accelerate itself to a race. One day he found himself arrested; his arm was seized by a portly personage, who had turned back on recognizing the young man and expended much breath in overtaking him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Signor Giovanni! Stay, my young friend!\" cried he. \"Have you forgotten me? That might well be the case if I were as much altered as yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Baglioni, whom Giovanni had avoided ever since their first meeting, from a doubt that the professor's sagacity would look too deeply into his secrets. Endeavoring to recover himself, he stared forth wildly from his inner world into the outer one and spoke like a man in a dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; I am Giovanni Guasconti. You are Professor Pietro Baglioni. Now let me pass!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet, not yet, Signor Giovanni Guasconti,\" said the professor, smiling, but at the same time scrutinizing the youth with an earnest glance. \"What! did I grow up side by side with your father? and shall his son pass me like a stranger in these old streets of Padua? Stand still, Signor Giovanni; for we must have a word or two before we part.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speedily, then, most worshipful professor, speedily,\" said Giovanni, with feverish impatience. \"Does not your worship see that I am in haste?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, while he was speaking there came a man in black along the street, stooping and moving feebly like a person in inferior health. His face was all overspread with a most sickly and sallow hue, but yet so pervaded with an expression of piercing and active intellect that an observer might easily have overlooked the merely physical attributes and have seen only this wonderful energy. As he passed, this person exchanged a cold and distant salutation with Baglioni, but fixed his eyes upon Giovanni with an intentness that seemed to bring out whatever was within him worthy of notice. Nevertheless, there was a peculiar quietness in the look, as if taking merely a speculative, not a human interest, in the young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is Dr. Rappaccini!\" whispered the professor when the stranger had passed. \"Has he ever seen your face before?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not that I know,\" answered Giovanni, starting at the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has seen you! he must have seen you!\" said Baglioni, hastily. \"For some purpose or other, this man of science is making a study of you. I know that look of his! It is the same that coldly illuminates his face as he bends over a bird, a mouse, or a butterfly, which, in pursuance of some experiment, he has killed by the perfume of a flower; a look as deep as Nature itself, but without Nature's warmth of love. Signor Giovanni, I will stake my life upon it, you are the subject of one of Rappaccini's experiments!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you make a fool of me?\" cried Giovanni, passionately. \"That, signor professor, were an untoward experiment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Patience! patience!\" replied the imperturbable professor. \"I tell thee, my poor Giovanni, that Rappaccini has a scientific interest in thee. Thou hast fallen into fearful hands! And the Signora Beatrice,--what part does she act in this mystery?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Guasconti, finding Baglioni's pertinacity intolerable, here broke away, and was gone before the professor could again seize his arm. He looked after the young man intently and shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This must not be,\" said Baglioni to himself. \"The youth is the son of my old friend, and shall not come to any harm from which the arcana of medical science can preserve him. Besides, it is too insufferable an impertinence in Rappaccini, thus to snatch the lad out of my own hands, as I may say, and make use of him for his infernal experiments. This daughter of his! It shall be looked to. Perchance, most learned Rappaccini, I may foil you where you little dream of it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Giovanni had pursued a circuitous route, and at length found himself at the door of his lodgings. As he crossed the threshold he was met by old Lisabetta, who smirked and smiled, and was evidently desirous to attract his attention; vainly, however, as the ebullition of his feelings had momentarily subsided into a cold and dull vacuity. He turned his eyes full upon the withered face that was puckering itself into a smile, but seemed to behold it not. The old dame, therefore, laid her grasp upon his cloak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Signor! signor!\" whispered she, still with a smile over the whole breadth of her visage, so that it looked not unlike a grotesque carving in wood, darkened by centuries. \"Listen, signor! There is a private entrance into the garden!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you say?\" exclaimed Giovanni, turning quickly about, as if an inanimate thing should start into feverish life. \"A private entrance into Dr. Rappaccini's garden?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush! hush! not so loud!\" whispered Lisabetta, putting her hand over his mouth. \"Yes; into the worshipful doctor's garden, where you may see all his fine shrubbery. Many a young man in Padua would give gold to be admitted among those flowers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Giovanni put a piece of gold into her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Show me the way,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "A surmise, probably excited by his conversation with Baglioni, crossed his mind, that this interposition of old Lisabetta might perchance be connected with the intrigue, whatever were its nature, in which the professor seemed to suppose that Dr. Rappaccini was involving him. But such a suspicion, though it disturbed Giovanni, was inadequate to restrain him. The instant that he was aware of the possibility of approaching Beatrice, it seemed an absolute necessity of his existence to do so. It mattered not whether she were angel or demon; he was irrevocably within her sphere, and must obey the law that whirled him onward, in ever-lessening circles, towards a result which he did not attempt to foreshadow; and yet, strange to say, there came across him a sudden doubt whether this intense interest on his part were not delusory; whether it were really of so deep and positive a nature as to justify him in now thrusting himself into an incalculable position; whether it were not merely the fantasy of a young man's brain, only slightly or not at all connected with his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, hesitated, turned half about, but again went on. His withered guide led him along several obscure passages, and finally undid a door, through which, as it was opened, there came the sight and sound of rustling leaves, with the broken sunshine glimmering among them. Giovanni stepped forth, and, forcing himself through the entanglement of a shrub that wreathed its tendrils over the hidden entrance, stood beneath his own window in the open area of Dr. Rappaccini's garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "How often is it the case that, when impossibilities have come to pass and dreams have condensed their misty substance into tangible realities, we find ourselves calm, and even coldly self-possessed, amid circumstances which it would have been a delirium of joy or agony to anticipate! Fate delights to thwart us thus. Passion will choose his own time to rush upon the scene, and lingers sluggishly behind when an appropriate adjustment of events would seem to summon his appearance. So was it now with Giovanni. Day after day his pulses had throbbed with feverish blood at the improbable idea of an interview with Beatrice, and of standing with her, face to face, in this very garden, basking in the Oriental sunshine of her beauty, and snatching from her full gaze the mystery which he deemed the riddle of his own existence. But now there was a singular and untimely equanimity within his breast. He threw a glance around the garden to discover if Beatrice or her father were present, and, perceiving that he was alone, began a critical observation of the plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aspect of one and all of them dissatisfied him; their gorgeousness seemed fierce, passionate, and even unnatural. There was hardly an individual shrub which a wanderer, straying by himself through a forest, would not have been startled to find growing wild, as if an unearthly face had glared at him out of the thicket. Several also would have shocked a delicate instinct by an appearance of artificialness indicating that there had been such commixture, and, as it were, adultery, of various vegetable species, that the production was no longer of God's making, but the monstrous offspring of man's depraved fancy, glowing with only an evil mockery of beauty. They were probably the result of experiment, which in one or two cases had succeeded in mingling plants individually lovely into a compound possessing the questionable and ominous character that distinguished the whole growth of the garden. In fine, Giovanni recognized but two or three plants in the collection, and those of a kind that he well knew to be poisonous. While busy with these contemplations he heard the rustling of a silken garment, and, turning, beheld Beatrice emerging from beneath the sculptured portal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giovanni had not considered with himself what should be his deportment; whether he should apologize for his intrusion into the garden, or assume that he was there with the privity at least, if not by the desire, of Dr. Rappaccini or his daughter; but Beatrice's manner placed him at his ease, though leaving him still in doubt by what agency he had gained admittance. She came lightly along the path and met him near the broken fountain. There was surprise in her face, but brightened by a simple and kind expression of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a connoisseur in flowers, signor,\" said Beatrice, with a smile, alluding to the bouquet which he had flung her from the window. \"It is no marvel, therefore, if the sight of my father's rare collection has tempted you to take a nearer view. If he were here, he could tell you many strange and interesting facts as to the nature and habits of these shrubs; for he has spent a lifetime in such studies, and this garden is his world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yourself, lady,\" observed Giovanni, \"if fame says true,--you likewise are deeply skilled in the virtues indicated by these rich blossoms and these spicy perfumes. Would you deign to be my instructress, I should prove an apter scholar than if taught by Signor Rappaccini himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there such idle rumors?\" asked Beatrice, with the music of a pleasant laugh. \"Do people say that I am skilled in my father's science of plants? What a jest is there! No; though I have grown up among these flowers, I know no more of them than their hues and perfume; and sometimes methinks I would fain rid myself of even that small knowledge. There are many flowers here, and those not the least brilliant, that shock and offend me when they meet my eye. But pray, signor, do not believe these stories about my science. Believe nothing of me save what you see with your own eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And must I believe all that I have seen with my own eyes?\" asked Giovanni, pointedly, while the recollection of former scenes made him shrink. \"No, signora; you demand too little of me. Bid me believe nothing save what comes from your own lips.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would appear that Beatrice understood him. There came a deep flush to her cheek; but she looked full into Giovanni's eyes, and responded to his gaze of uneasy suspicion with a queenlike haughtiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do so bid you, signor,\" she replied. \"Forget whatever you may have fancied in regard to me. If true to the outward senses, still it may be false in its essence; but the words of Beatrice Rappaccini's lips are true from the depths of the heart outward. Those you may believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A fervor glowed in her whole aspect and beamed upon Giovanni's consciousness like the light of truth itself; but while she spoke there was a fragrance in the atmosphere around her, rich and delightful, though evanescent, yet which the young man, from an indefinable reluctance, scarcely dared to draw into his lungs. It might be the odor of the flowers. Could it be Beatrice's breath which thus embalmed her words with a strange richness, as if by steeping them in her heart? A faintness passed like a shadow over Giovanni and flitted away; he seemed to gaze through the beautiful girl's eyes into her transparent soul, and felt no more doubt or fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tinge of passion that had colored Beatrice's manner vanished; she became gay, and appeared to derive a pure delight from her communion with the youth not unlike what the maiden of a lonely island might have felt conversing with a voyager from the civilized world. Evidently her experience of life had been confined within the limits of that garden. She talked now about matters as simple as the daylight or summer clouds, and now asked questions in reference to the city, or Giovanni's distant home, his friends, his mother, and his sisters--questions indicating such seclusion, and such lack of familiarity with modes and forms, that Giovanni responded as if to an infant. Her spirit gushed out before him like a fresh rill that was just catching its first glimpse of the sunlight and wondering at the reflections of earth and sky which were flung into its bosom. There came thoughts, too, from a deep source, and fantasies of a gemlike brilliancy, as if diamonds and rubies sparkled upward among the bubbles of the fountain. Ever and anon there gleamed across the young man's mind a sense of wonder that he should be walking side by side with the being who had so wrought upon his imagination, whom he had idealized in such hues of terror, in whom he had positively witnessed such manifestations of dreadful attributes,--that he should be conversing with Beatrice like a brother, and should find her so human and so maidenlike. But such reflections were only momentary; the effect of her character was too real not to make itself familiar at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this free intercourse they had strayed through the garden, and now, after many turns among its avenues, were come to the shattered fountain, beside which grew the magnificent shrub, with its treasury of glowing blossoms. A fragrance was diffused from it which Giovanni recognized as identical with that which he had attributed to Beatrice's breath, but incomparably more powerful. As her eyes fell upon it, Giovanni beheld her press her hand to her bosom as if her heart were throbbing suddenly and painfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the first time in my life,\" murmured she, addressing the shrub, \"I had forgotten thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember, signora,\" said Giovanni, \"that you once promised to reward me with one of these living gems for the bouquet which I had the happy boldness to fling to your feet. Permit me now to pluck it as a memorial of this interview.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He made a step towards the shrub with extended hand; but Beatrice darted forward, uttering a shriek that went through his heart like a dagger. She caught his hand and drew it back with the whole force of her slender figure. Giovanni felt her touch thrilling through his fibres.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Touch it not!\" exclaimed she, in a voice of agony. \"Not for thy life! It is fatal!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, hiding her face, she fled from him and vanished beneath the sculptured portal. As Giovanni followed her with his eyes, he beheld the emaciated figure and pale intelligence of Dr. Rappaccini, who had been watching the scene, he knew not how long, within the shadow of the entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner was Guasconti alone in his chamber than the image of Beatrice came back to his passionate musings, invested with all the witchery that had been gathering around it ever since his first glimpse of her, and now likewise imbued with a tender warmth of girlish womanhood. She was human; her nature was endowed with all gentle and feminine qualities; she was worthiest to be worshipped; she was capable, surely, on her part, of the height and heroism of love. Those tokens which he had hitherto considered as proofs of a frightful peculiarity in her physical and moral system were now either forgotten, or, by the subtle sophistry of passion transmitted into a golden crown of enchantment, rendering Beatrice the more admirable by so much as she was the more unique. Whatever had looked ugly was now beautiful; or, if incapable of such a change, it stole away and hid itself among those shapeless half ideas which throng the dim region beyond the daylight of our perfect consciousness. Thus did he spend the night, nor fell asleep until the dawn had begun to awake the slumbering flowers in Dr. Rappaccini's garden, whither Giovanni's dreams doubtless led him. Up rose the sun in his due season, and, flinging his beams upon the young man's eyelids, awoke him to a sense of pain. When thoroughly aroused, he became sensible of a burning and tingling agony in his hand--in his right hand--the very hand which Beatrice had grasped in her own when he was on the point of plucking one of the gemlike flowers. On the back of that hand there was now a purple print like that of four small fingers, and the likeness of a slender thumb upon his wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, how stubbornly does love,--or even that cunning semblance of love which flourishes in the imagination, but strikes no depth of root into the heart,--how stubbornly does it hold its faith until the moment comes when it is doomed to vanish into thin mist! Giovanni wrapped a handkerchief about his hand and wondered what evil thing had stung him, and soon forgot his pain in a reverie of Beatrice.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the first interview, a second was in the inevitable course of what we call fate. A third; a fourth; and a meeting with Beatrice in the garden was no longer an incident in Giovanni's daily life, but the whole space in which he might be said to live; for the anticipation and memory of that ecstatic hour made up the remainder. Nor was it otherwise with the daughter of Rappaccini. She watched for the youth's appearance, and flew to his side with confidence as unreserved as if they had been playmates from early infancy--as if they were such playmates still. If, by any unwonted chance, he failed to come at the appointed moment, she stood beneath the window and sent up the rich sweetness of her tones to float around him in his chamber and echo and reverberate throughout his heart: \"Giovanni! Giovanni! Why tarriest thou? Come down!\" And down he hastened into that Eden of poisonous flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, with all this intimate familiarity, there was still a reserve in Beatrice's demeanor, so rigidly and invariably sustained that the idea of infringing it scarcely occurred to his imagination. By all appreciable signs, they loved; they had looked love with eyes that conveyed the holy secret from the depths of one soul into the depths of the other, as if it were too sacred to be whispered by the way; they had even spoken love in those gushes of passion when their spirits darted forth in articulated breath like tongues of long-hidden flame; and yet there had been no seal of lips, no clasp of hands, nor any slightest caress such as love claims and hallows. He had never touched one of the gleaming ringlets of her hair; her garment--so marked was the physical barrier between them--had never been waved against him by a breeze. On the few occasions when Giovanni had seemed tempted to overstep the limit, Beatrice grew so sad, so stern, and withal wore such a look of desolate separation, shuddering at itself, that not a spoken word was requisite to repel him. At such times he was startled at the horrible suspicions that rose, monster-like, out of the caverns of his heart and stared him in the face; his love grew thin and faint as the morning mist, his doubts alone had substance. But, when Beatrice's face brightened again after the momentary shadow, she was transformed at once from the mysterious, questionable being whom he had watched with so much awe and horror; she was now the beautiful and unsophisticated girl whom he felt that his spirit knew with a certainty beyond all other knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "A considerable time had now passed since Giovanni's last meeting with Baglioni. One morning, however, he was disagreeably surprised by a visit from the professor, whom he had scarcely thought of for whole weeks, and would willingly have forgotten still longer. Given up as he had long been to a pervading excitement, he could tolerate no companions except upon condition of their perfect sympathy with his present state of feeling. Such sympathy was not to be expected from Professor Baglioni.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitor chatted carelessly for a few moments about the gossip of the city and the university, and then took up another topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been reading an old classic author lately,\" said he, \"and met with a story that strangely interested me. Possibly you may remember it. It is of an Indian prince, who sent a beautiful woman as a present to Alexander the Great. She was as lovely as the dawn and gorgeous as the sunset; but what especially distinguished her was a certain rich perfume in her breath--richer than a garden of Persian roses. Alexander, as was natural to a youthful conqueror, fell in love at first sight with this magnificent stranger; but a certain sage physician, happening to be present, discovered a terrible secret in regard to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what was that?\" asked Giovanni, turning his eyes downward to avoid those of the professor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That this lovely woman,\" continued Baglioni, with emphasis, \"had been nourished with poisons from her birth upward, until her whole nature was so imbued with them that she herself had become the deadliest poison in existence. Poison was her element of life. With that rich perfume of her breath she blasted the very air. Her love would have been poison--her embrace death. Is not this a marvellous tale?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A childish fable,\" answered Giovanni, nervously starting from his chair. \"I marvel how your worship finds time to read such nonsense among your graver studies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By the by,\" said the professor, looking uneasily about him, \"what singular fragrance is this in your apartment? Is it the perfume of your gloves? It is faint, but delicious; and yet, after all, by no means agreeable. Were I to breathe it long, methinks it would make me ill. It is like the breath of a flower; but I see no flowers in the chamber.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor are there any,\" replied Giovanni, who had turned pale as the professor spoke; \"nor, I think, is there any fragrance except in your worship's imagination. Odors, being a sort of element combined of the sensual and the spiritual, are apt to deceive us in this manner. The recollection of a perfume, the bare idea of it, may easily be mistaken for a present reality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay; but my sober imagination does not often play such tricks,\" said Baglioni; \"and, were I to fancy any kind of odor, it would be that of some vile apothecary drug, wherewith my fingers are likely enough to be imbued. Our worshipful friend Rappaccini, as I have heard, tinctures his medicaments with odors richer than those of Araby. Doubtless, likewise, the fair and learned Signora Beatrice would minister to her patients with draughts as sweet as a maiden's breath; but woe to him that sips them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Giovanni's face evinced many contending emotions. The tone in which the professor alluded to the pure and lovely daughter of Rappaccini was a torture to his soul; and yet the intimation of a view of her character opposite to his own, gave instantaneous distinctness to a thousand dim suspicions, which now grinned at him like so many demons. But he strove hard to quell them and to respond to Baglioni with a true lover's perfect faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Signor professor,\" said he, \"you were my father's friend; perchance, too, it is your purpose to act a friendly part towards his son. I would fain feel nothing towards you save respect and deference; but I pray you to observe, signor, that there is one subject on which we must not speak. You know not the Signora Beatrice. You cannot, therefore, estimate the wrong--the blasphemy, I may even say--that is offered to her character by a light or injurious word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Giovanni! my poor Giovanni!\" answered the professor, with a calm expression of pity, \"I know this wretched girl far better than yourself. You shall hear the truth in respect to the poisoner Rappaccini and his poisonous daughter; yes, poisonous as she is beautiful. Listen; for, even should you do violence to my gray hairs, it shall not silence me. That old fable of the Indian woman has become a truth by the deep and deadly science of Rappaccini and in the person of the lovely Beatrice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Giovanni groaned and hid his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her father,\" continued Baglioni, \"was not restrained by natural affection from offering up his child in this horrible manner as the victim of his insane zeal for science; for, let us do him justice, he is as true a man of science as ever distilled his own heart in an alembic. What, then, will be your fate? Beyond a doubt you are selected as the material of some new experiment. Perhaps the result is to be death; perhaps a fate more awful still. Rappaccini, with what he calls the interest of science before his eyes, will hesitate at nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a dream,\" muttered Giovanni to himself; \"surely it is a dream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" resumed the professor, \"be of good cheer, son of my friend. It is not yet too late for the rescue. Possibly we may even succeed in bringing back this miserable child within the limits of ordinary nature, from which her father's madness has estranged her. Behold this little silver vase! It was wrought by the hands of the renowned Benvenuto Cellini, and is well worthy to be a love gift to the fairest dame in Italy. But its contents are invaluable. One little sip of this antidote would have rendered the most virulent poisons of the Borgias innocuous. Doubt not that it will be as efficacious against those of Rappaccini. Bestow the vase, and the precious liquid within it, on your Beatrice, and hopefully await the result.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Baglioni laid a small, exquisitely wrought silver vial on the table and withdrew, leaving what he had said to produce its effect upon the young man's mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will thwart Rappaccini yet,\" thought he, chuckling to himself, as he descended the stairs; \"but, let us confess the truth of him, he is a wonderful man--a wonderful man indeed; a vile empiric, however, in his practice, and therefore not to be tolerated by those who respect the good old rules of the medical profession.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout Giovanni's whole acquaintance with Beatrice, he had occasionally, as we have said, been haunted by dark surmises as to her character; yet so thoroughly had she made herself felt by him as a simple, natural, most affectionate, and guileless creature, that the image now held up by Professor Baglioni looked as strange and incredible as if it were not in accordance with his own original conception. True, there were ugly recollections connected with his first glimpses of the beautiful girl; he could not quite forget the bouquet that withered in her grasp, and the insect that perished amid the sunny air, by no ostensible agency save the fragrance of her breath. These incidents, however, dissolving in the pure light of her character, had no longer the efficacy of facts, but were acknowledged as mistaken fantasies, by whatever testimony of the senses they might appear to be substantiated. There is something truer and more real than what we can see with the eyes and touch with the finger. On such better evidence had Giovanni founded his confidence in Beatrice, though rather by the necessary force of her high attributes than by any deep and generous faith on his part. But now his spirit was incapable of sustaining itself at the height to which the early enthusiasm of passion had exalted it; he fell down, grovelling among earthly doubts, and defiled therewith the pure whiteness of Beatrice's image. Not that he gave her up; he did but distrust. He resolved to institute some decisive test that should satisfy him, once for all, whether there were those dreadful peculiarities in her physical nature which could not be supposed to exist without some corresponding monstrosity of soul. His eyes, gazing down afar, might have deceived him as to the lizard, the insect, and the flowers; but if he could witness, at the distance of a few paces, the sudden blight of one fresh and healthful flower in Beatrice's hand, there would be room for no further question. With this idea he hastened to the florist's and purchased a bouquet that was still gemmed with the morning dew-drops.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now the customary hour of his daily interview with Beatrice. Before descending into the garden, Giovanni failed not to look at his figure in the mirror,--a vanity to be expected in a beautiful young man, yet, as displaying itself at that troubled and feverish moment, the token of a certain shallowness of feeling and insincerity of character. He did gaze, however, and said to himself that his features had never before possessed so rich a grace, nor his eyes such vivacity, nor his cheeks so warm a hue of superabundant life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At least,\" thought he, \"her poison has not yet insinuated itself into my system. I am no flower to perish in her grasp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With that thought he turned his eyes on the bouquet, which he had never once laid aside from his hand. A thrill of indefinable horror shot through his frame on perceiving that those dewy flowers were already beginning to droop; they wore the aspect of things that had been fresh and lovely yesterday. Giovanni grew white as marble, and stood motionless before the mirror, staring at his own reflection there as at the likeness of something frightful. He remembered Baglioni's remark about the fragrance that seemed to pervade the chamber. It must have been the poison in his breath! Then he shuddered--shuddered at himself. Recovering from his stupor, he began to watch with curious eye a spider that was busily at work hanging its web from the antique cornice of the apartment, crossing and recrossing the artful system of interwoven lines--as vigorous and active a spider as ever dangled from an old ceiling. Giovanni bent towards the insect, and emitted a deep, long breath. The spider suddenly ceased its toil; the web vibrated with a tremor originating in the body of the small artisan. Again Giovanni sent forth a breath, deeper, longer, and imbued with a venomous feeling out of his heart: he knew not whether he were wicked, or only desperate. The spider made a convulsive gripe with his limbs and hung dead across the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Accursed! accursed!\" muttered Giovanni, addressing himself. \"Hast thou grown so poisonous that this deadly insect perishes by thy breath?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment a rich, sweet voice came floating up from the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Giovanni! Giovanni! It is past the hour! Why tarriest thou? Come down!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" muttered Giovanni again. \"She is the only being whom my breath may not slay! Would that it might!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He rushed down, and in an instant was standing before the bright and loving eyes of Beatrice. A moment ago his wrath and despair had been so fierce that he could have desired nothing so much as to wither her by a glance; but with her actual presence there came influences which had too real an existence to be at once shaken off: recollections of the delicate and benign power of her feminine nature, which had so often enveloped him in a religious calm; recollections of many a holy and passionate outgush of her heart, when the pure fountain had been unsealed from its depths and made visible in its transparency to his mental eye; recollections which, had Giovanni known how to estimate them, would have assured him that all this ugly mystery was but an earthly illusion, and that, whatever mist of evil might seem to have gathered over her, the real Beatrice was a heavenly angel. Incapable as he was of such high faith, still her presence had not utterly lost its magic. Giovanni's rage was quelled into an aspect of sullen insensibility. Beatrice, with a quick spiritual sense, immediately felt that there was a gulf of blackness between them which neither he nor she could pass. They walked on together, sad and silent, and came thus to the marble fountain and to its pool of water on the ground, in the midst of which grew the shrub that bore gem-like blossoms. Giovanni was affrighted at the eager enjoyment--the appetite, as it were--with which he found himself inhaling the fragrance of the flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beatrice,\" asked he, abruptly, \"whence came this shrub?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father created it,\" answered she, with simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Created it! created it!\" repeated Giovanni. \"What mean you, Beatrice?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a man fearfully acquainted with the secrets of Nature,\" replied Beatrice; \"and, at the hour when I first drew breath, this plant sprang from the soil, the offspring of his science, of his intellect, while I was but his earthly child. Approach it not!\" continued she, observing with terror that Giovanni was drawing nearer to the shrub. \"It has qualities that you little dream of. But I, dearest Giovanni,--I grew up and blossomed with the plant and was nourished with its breath. It was my sister, and I loved it with a human affection; for, alas!--hast thou not suspected it?--there was an awful doom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Giovanni frowned so darkly upon her that Beatrice paused and trembled. But her faith in his tenderness reassured her, and made her blush that she had doubted for an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was an awful doom,\" she continued, \"the effect of my father's fatal love of science, which estranged me from all society of my kind. Until Heaven sent thee, dearest Giovanni, oh, how lonely was thy poor Beatrice!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was it a hard doom?\" asked Giovanni, fixing his eyes upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only of late have I known how hard it was,\" answered she, tenderly. \"Oh, yes; but my heart was torpid, and therefore quiet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Giovanni's rage broke forth from his sullen gloom like a lightning flash out of a dark cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Accursed one!\" cried he, with venomous scorn and anger. \"And, finding thy solitude wearisome, thou hast severed me likewise from all the warmth of life and enticed me into thy region of unspeakable horror!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Giovanni!\" exclaimed Beatrice, turning her large bright eyes upon his face. The force of his words had not found its way into her mind; she was merely thunderstruck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, poisonous thing!\" repeated Giovanni, beside himself with passion. \"Thou hast done it! Thou hast blasted me! Thou hast filled my veins with poison! Thou hast made me as hateful, as ugly, as loathsome and deadly a creature as thyself--a world's wonder of hideous monstrosity! Now, if our breath be happily as fatal to ourselves as to all others, let us join our lips in one kiss of unutterable hatred, and so die!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has befallen me?\" murmured Beatrice, with a low moan out of her heart. \"Holy Virgin, pity me, a poor heart-broken child!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou,--dost thou pray?\" cried Giovanni, still with the same fiendish scorn. \"Thy very prayers, as they come from thy lips, taint the atmosphere with death. Yes, yes; let us pray! Let us to church and dip our fingers in the holy water at the portal! They that come after us will perish as by a pestilence! Let us sign crosses in the air! It will be scattering curses abroad in the likeness of holy symbols!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Giovanni,\" said Beatrice, calmly, for her grief was beyond passion, \"why dost thou join thyself with me thus in those terrible words? I, it is true, am the horrible thing thou namest me. But thou,--what hast thou to do, save with one other shudder at my hideous misery to go forth out of the garden and mingle with thy race, and forget there ever crawled on earth such a monster as poor Beatrice?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dost thou pretend ignorance?\" asked Giovanni, scowling upon her. \"Behold! this power have I gained from the pure daughter of Rappaccini.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a swarm of summer insects flitting through the air in search of the food promised by the flower odors of the fatal garden. They circled round Giovanni's head, and were evidently attracted towards him by the same influence which had drawn them for an instant within the sphere of several of the shrubs. He sent forth a breath among them, and smiled bitterly at Beatrice as at least a score of the insects fell dead upon the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see it! I see it!\" shrieked Beatrice. \"It is my father's fatal science! No, no, Giovanni; it was not I! Never! never! I dreamed only to love thee and be with thee a little time, and so to let thee pass away, leaving but thine image in mine heart; for, Giovanni, believe it, though my body be nourished with poison, my spirit is God's creature, and craves love as its daily food. But my father,--he has united us in this fearful sympathy. Yes; spurn me, tread upon me, kill me! Oh, what is death after such words as thine? But it was not I. Not for a world of bliss would I have done it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Giovanni's passion had exhausted itself in its outburst from his lips. There now came across him a sense, mournful, and not without tenderness, of the intimate and peculiar relationship between Beatrice and himself. They stood, as it were, in an utter solitude, which would be made none the less solitary by the densest throng of human life. Ought not, then, the desert of humanity around them to press this insulated pair closer together? If they should be cruel to one another, who was there to be kind to them? Besides, thought Giovanni, might there not still be a hope of his returning within the limits of ordinary nature, and leading Beatrice, the redeemed Beatrice, by the hand? O, weak, and selfish, and unworthy spirit, that could dream of an earthly union and earthly happiness as possible, after such deep love had been so bitterly wronged as was Beatrice's love by Giovanni's blighting words! No, no; there could be no such hope. She must pass heavily, with that broken heart, across the borders of Time--she must bathe her hurts in some fount of paradise, and forget her grief in the light of immortality, and there be well.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Giovanni did not know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Beatrice,\" said he, approaching her, while she shrank away as always at his approach, but now with a different impulse, \"dearest Beatrice, our fate is not yet so desperate. Behold! there is a medicine, potent, as a wise physician has assured me, and almost divine in its efficacy. It is composed of ingredients the most opposite to those by which thy awful father has brought this calamity upon thee and me. It is distilled of blessed herbs. Shall we not quaff it together, and thus be purified from evil?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give it me!\" said Beatrice, extending her hand to receive the little silver vial which Giovanni took from his bosom. She added, with a peculiar emphasis, \"I will drink; but do thou await the result.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She put Baglioni's antidote to her lips; and, at the same moment, the figure of Rappaccini emerged from the portal and came slowly towards the marble fountain. As he drew near, the pale man of science seemed to gaze with a triumphant expression at the beautiful youth and maiden, as might an artist who should spend his life in achieving a picture or a group of statuary and finally be satisfied with his success. He paused; his bent form grew erect with conscious power; he spread out his hands over them in the attitude of a father imploring a blessing upon his children; but those were the same hands that had thrown poison into the stream of their lives. Giovanni trembled. Beatrice shuddered nervously, and pressed her hand upon her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My daughter,\" said Rappaccini, \"thou art no longer lonely in the world. Pluck one of those precious gems from thy sister shrub and bid thy bridegroom wear it in his bosom. It will not harm him now. My science and the sympathy between thee and him have so wrought within his system that he now stands apart from common men, as thou dost, daughter of my pride and triumph, from ordinary women. Pass on, then, through the world, most dear to one another and dreadful to all besides!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father,\" said Beatrice, feebly,--and still as she spoke she kept her hand upon her heart,--\"wherefore didst thou inflict this miserable doom upon thy child?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miserable!\" exclaimed Rappaccini. \"What mean you, foolish girl? Dost thou deem it misery to be endowed with marvellous gifts against which no power nor strength could avail an enemy--misery, to be able to quell the mightiest with a breath--misery, to be as terrible as thou art beautiful? Wouldst thou, then, have preferred the condition of a weak woman, exposed to all evil and capable of none?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would fain have been loved, not feared,\" murmured Beatrice, sinking down upon the ground. \"But now it matters not. I am going, father, where the evil which thou hast striven to mingle with my being will pass away like a dream-like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers, which will no longer taint my breath among the flowers of Eden. Farewell, Giovanni! Thy words of hatred are like lead within my heart; but they, too, will fall away as I ascend. Oh, was there not, from the first, more poison in thy nature than in mine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To Beatrice,--so radically had her earthly part been wrought upon by Rappaccini's skill,--as poison had been life, so the powerful antidote was death; and thus the poor victim of man's ingenuity and of thwarted nature, and of the fatality that attends all such efforts of perverted wisdom, perished there, at the feet of her father and Giovanni. Just at that moment Professor Pietro Baglioni looked forth from the window, and called loudly, in a tone of triumph mixed with horror, to the thunderstricken man of science,\"Rappaccini! Rappaccini! and is this the upshot of your experiment!\"\n",

      "There is a certain church in the city of New York which I have always regarded with peculiar interest, on account of a marriage there solemnized, under very singular circumstances, in my grandmother's girlhood. That venerable lady chanced to be a spectator of the scene, and ever after made it her favorite narrative. Whether the edifice now standing on the same site be the identical one to which she referred, I am not antiquarian enough to know; nor would it be worth while to correct myself, perhaps, of an agreeable error, by reading the date of its erection on the tablet over the door. It is a stately church, surrounded by an inclosure of the loveliest green, within which appear urns, pillars, obelisks, and other forms of monumental marble, the tributes of private affection, or more splendid memorials of historic dust. With such a place, though the tumult of the city rolls beneath its tower, one would be willing to connect some legendary interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marriage might be considered as the result of an early engagement, though there had been two intermediate weddings on the lady's part, and forty years of celibacy on that of the gentleman. At sixty-five, Mr. Ellenwood was a shy, but not quite a secluded man; selfish, like all men who brood over their own hearts, yet manifesting on rare occasions a vein of generous sentiment; a scholar throughout life, though always an indolent one, because his studies had no definite object, either of public advantage or personal ambition; a gentleman, high bred and fastidiously delicate, yet sometimes requiring a considerable relaxation, in his behalf, of the common rules of society. In truth, there were so many anomalies in his character, and though shrinking with diseased sensibility from public notice, it had been his fatality so often to become the topic of the day, by some wild eccentricity of conduct, that people searched his lineage for an hereditary taint of insanity. But there was no need of this. His caprices had their origin in a mind that lacked the support of an engrossing purpose, and in feelings that preyed upon themselves for want of other food. If he were mad, it was the consequence, and not the cause, of an aimless and abortive life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow was as complete a contrast to her third bridegroom, in everything but age, as can well be conceived. Compelled to relinquish her first engagement, she had been united to a man of twice her own years, to whom she became an exemplary wife, and by whose death she was left in possession of a splendid fortune. A southern gentleman, considerably younger than herself, succeeded to her hand, and carried her to Charleston, where, after many uncomfortable years, she found herself again a widow. It would have been singular, if any uncommon delicacy of feeling had survived through such a life as Mrs. Dabney's; it could not but be crushed and killed by her early disappointment, the cold duty of her first marriage, the dislocation of the heart's principles, consequent on a second union, and the unkindness of her southern husband, which had inevitably driven her to connect the idea of his death with that of her comfort. To be brief, she was that wisest, but unloveliest, variety of woman, a philosopher, bearing troubles of the heart with equanimity, dispensing with all that should have been her happiness, and making the best of what remained. Sage in most matters, the widow was perhaps the more amiable for the one frailty that made her ridiculous. Being childless, she could not remain beautiful by proxy, in the person of a daughter; she therefore refused to grow old and ugly, on any consideration; she struggled with Time, and held fast her roses in spite of him, till the venerable thief appeared to have relinquished the spoil, as not worth the trouble of acquiring it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The approaching marriage of this woman of the world with such an unworldly man as Mr. Ellenwood was announced soon after Mrs. Dabney's return to her native city. Superficial observers, and deeper ones, seemed to concur in supposing that the lady must have borne no inactive part in arranging the affair; there were considerations of expediency which she would be far more likely to appreciate than Mr. Ellenwood; and there was just the specious phantom of sentiment and romance in this late union of two early lovers which sometimes makes a fool of a woman who has lost her true feelings among the accidents of life. All the wonder was, how the gentleman, with his lack of worldly wisdom and agonizing consciousness of ridicule, could have been induced to take a measure at once so prudent and so laughable. But while people talked the wedding-day arrived. The ceremony was to be solemnized according to the Episcopalian forms, and in open church, with a degree of publicity that attracted many spectators, who occupied the front seats of the galleries, and the pews near the altar and along the broad aisle. It had been arranged, or possibly it was the custom of the day, that the parties should proceed separately to church. By some accident the bridegroom was a little less punctual than the widow and her bridal attendants; with whose arrival, after this tedious, but necessary preface, the action of our tale may be said to commence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clumsy wheels of several old-fashioned coaches were heard, and the gentlemen and ladies composing the bridal party came through the church door with the sudden and gladsome effect of a burst of sunshine. The whole group, except the principal figure, was made up of youth and gayety. As they streamed up the broad aisle, while the pews and pillars seemed to brighten on either side, their steps were as buoyant as if they mistook the church for a ball-room, and were ready to dance hand in hand to the altar. So brilliant was the spectacle that few took notice of a singular phenomenon that had marked its entrance. At the moment when the bride's foot touched the threshold the bell swung heavily in the tower above her, and sent forth its deepest knell. The vibrations died away and returned with prolonged solemnity, as she entered the body of the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens! what an omen,\" whispered a young lady to her lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On my honor,\" replied the gentleman, \"I believe the bell has the good taste to toll of its own accord. What has she to do with weddings? If you, dearest Julia, were approaching the altar the bell would ring out its merriest peal. It has only a funeral knell for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The bride and most of her company had been too much occupied with the bustle of entrance to hear the first boding stroke of the bell, or at least to reflect on the singularity of such a welcome to the altar. They therefore continued to advance with undiminished gayety. The gorgeous dresses of the time, the crimson velvet coats, the gold-laced hats, the hoop petticoats, the silk, satin, brocade, and embroidery, the buckles, canes, and swords, all displayed to the best advantage on persons suited to such finery, made the group appear more like a bright-colored picture than anything real. But by what perversity of taste had the artist represented his principal figure as so wrinkled and decayed, while yet he had decked her out in the brightest splendor of attire, as if the loveliest maiden had suddenly withered into age, and become a moral to the beautiful around her! On they went, however, and had glittered along about a third of the aisle, when another stroke of the bell seemed to fill the church with a visible gloom, dimming and obscuring the bright pageant, till it shone forth again as from a mist.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time the party wavered, stopped, and huddled closer together, while a slight scream was heard from some of the ladies, and a confused whispering among the gentlemen. Thus tossing to and fro, they might have been fancifully compared to a splendid bunch of flowers, suddenly shaken by a puff of wind, which threatened to scatter the leaves of an old, brown, withered rose, on the same stalk with two dewy buds,--such being the emblem of the widow between her fair young bridemaids. But her heroism was admirable. She had started with an irrepressible shudder, as if the stroke of the bell had fallen directly on her heart; then, recovering herself, while her attendants were yet in dismay, she took the lead, and paced calmly up the aisle. The bell continued to swing, strike, and vibrate, with the same doleful regularity as when a corpse is on its way to the tomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My young friends here have their nerves a little shaken,\" said the widow, with a smile, to the clergyman at the altar. \"But so many weddings have been ushered in with the merriest peal of the bells, and yet turned out unhappily, that I shall hope for better fortune under such different auspices.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam,\" answered the rector, in great perplexity, \"this strange occurrence brings to my mind a marriage sermon of the famous Bishop Taylor, wherein he mingles so many thoughts of mortality and future woe, that, to speak somewhat after his own rich style, he seems to hang the bridal chamber in black, and cut the wedding garment out of a coffin pall. And it has been the custom of divers nations to infuse something of sadness into their marriage ceremonies, so to keep death in mind while contracting that engagement which is life's chiefest business. Thus we may draw a sad but profitable moral from this funeral knell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though the clergyman might have given his moral even a keener point, he did not fail to dispatch an attendant to inquire into the mystery, and stop those sounds, so dismally appropriate to such a marriage. A brief space elapsed, during which the silence was broken only by whispers, and a few suppressed titterings, among the wedding party and the spectators, who, after the first shock, were disposed to draw an ill-natured merriment from the affair. The young have less charity for aged follies than the old for those of youth. The widow's glance was observed to wander, for an instant, towards a window of the church, as if searching for the time-worn marble that she had dedicated to her first husband; then her eyelids dropped over their faded orbs, and her thoughts were drawn irresistibly to another grave. Two buried men, with a voice at her ear, and a cry afar off, were calling her to lie down beside them. Perhaps, with momentary truth of feeling, she thought how much happier had been her fate, if, after years of bliss, the bell were now tolling for her funeral, and she were followed to the grave by the old affection of her earliest lover, long her husband. But why had she returned to him, when their cold hearts shrank from each other's embrace?\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the death-bell tolled so mournfully, that the sunshine seemed to fade in the air. A whisper, communicated from those who stood nearest the windows, now spread through the church; a hearse, with a train of several coaches, was creeping along the street, conveying some dead man to the churchyard, while the bride awaited a living one at the altar. Immediately after, the footsteps of the bridegroom and his friends were heard at the door. The widow looked down the aisle, and clinched the arm of one of her bridemaids in her bony hand with such unconscious violence, that the fair girl trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You frighten me, my dear madam!\" cried she. \"For Heaven's sake, what is the matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, my dear, nothing,\" said the widow; then, whispering close to her ear, \"There is a foolish fancy that I cannot get rid of. I am expecting my bridegroom to come into the church, with my first two husbands for groomsmen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, look!\" screamed the bridemaid. \"What is here? The funeral!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, a dark procession paced into the church. First came an old man and women, like chief mourners at a funeral, attired from head to foot in the deepest black, all but their pale features and hoary hair; he leaning on a staff, and supporting her decrepit form with his nerveless arm. Behind appeared another, and another pair, as aged, as black, and mournful as the first. As they drew near, the widow recognized in every face some trait of former friends, long forgotten, but now returning, as if from their old graves, to warn her to prepare a shroud; or, with purpose almost as unwelcome, to exhibit their wrinkles and infirmity, and claim her as their companion by the tokens of her own decay. Many a merry night had she danced with them, in youth. And now, in joyless age, she felt that some withered partner should request her hand, and all unite, in a dance of death, to the music of the funeral bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these aged mourners were passing up the aisle, it was observed that, from pew to pew, the spectators shuddered with irrepressible awe, as some object, hitherto concealed by the intervening figures, came full in sight. Many turned away their faces; others kept a fixed and rigid stare; and a young girl giggled hysterically, and fainted with the laughter on her lips. When the spectral procession approached the altar, each couple separated, and slowly diverged, till, in the centre, appeared a form, that had been worthily ushered in with all this gloomy pomp, the death knell, and the funeral. It was the bridegroom in his shroud!\n",
      "\n",
      "No garb but that of the grave could have befitted such a deathlike aspect; the eyes, indeed, had the wild gleam of a sepulchral lamp; all else was fixed in the stern calmness which old men wear in the coffin. The corpse stood motionless, but addressed the widow in accents that seemed to melt into the clang of the bell, which fell heavily on the air while he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, my bride!\" said those pale lips, \"the hearse is ready. The sexton stands waiting for us at the door of the tomb. Let us be married; and then to our coffins!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How shall the widow's horror be represented? It gave her the ghastliness of a dead man's bride. Her youthful friends stood apart, shuddering at the mourners, the shrouded bridegroom, and herself; the whole scene expressed, by the strongest imagery, the vain struggle of the gilded vanities of this world, when opposed to age, infirmity, sorrow, and death. The awe-struck silence was first broken by the clergyman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Ellenwood,\" said he, soothingly, yet with somewhat of authority, \"you are not well. Your mind has been agitated by the unusual circumstances in which you are placed. The ceremony must be deferred. As an old friend, let me entreat you to return home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Home! yes, but not without my bride,\" answered he, in the same hollow accents. \"You deem this mockery; perhaps madness. Had I bedizened my aged and broken frame with scarlet and embroidery--had I forced my withered lips to smile at my dead heart--that might have been mockery, or madness. But now, let young and old declare, which of us has come hither without a wedding garment, the bridegroom or the bride!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped forward at a ghostly pace, and stood beside the widow, contrasting the awful simplicity of his shroud with the glare and glitter in which she had arrayed herself for this unhappy scene. None, that beheld them, could deny the terrible strength of the moral which his disordered intellect had contrived to draw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cruel! cruel!\" groaned the heart-stricken bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cruel!\" repeated he; then, losing his deathlike composure in a wild bitterness: \"Heaven judge which of us has been cruel to the other! In youth you deprived me of my happiness, my hopes, my aims; you took away all the substance of my life, and made it a dream without reality enough even to grieve at--with only a pervading gloom, through which I walked wearily, and cared not whither. But after forty years, when I have built my tomb, and would not give up the thought of resting there--nor not for such a life as we once pictured--you call me to the altar. At your summons I am here. But other husbands have enjoyed your youth, your beauty, your warmth of heart, and all that could be termed your life. What is there for me but your decay and death? And therefore I have bidden these funeral friends, and bespoken the sexton's deepest knell, and am come, in my shroud, to wed you, as with a burial service, that we may join our hands at the door of the sepulchre, and enter it together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not frenzy; it was not merely the drunkenness of strong emotion, in a heart unused to it, that now wrought upon the bride. The stern lesson of the day had done its work; her worldliness was gone. She seized the bridegroom's hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes!\" cried she. \"Let us wed, even at the door of the sepulchre! My life is gone in vanity and emptiness. But at its close there is one true feeling. It has made me what I was in youth; it makes me worthy of you. Time is no more for both of us. Let us wed for Eternity!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a long and deep regard, the bridegroom looked into her eyes, while a tear was gathering in his own. How strange that gush of human feeling from the frozen bosom of a corpse! He wiped away the tears even with his shroud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beloved of my youth,\" said he, \"I have been wild. The despair of my whole lifetime had returned at once, and maddened me. Forgive; and be forgiven. Yes; it is evening with us now; and we have realized none of our morning dreams of happiness. But let us join our hands before the altar as lovers whom adverse circumstances have separated through life, yet who meet again as they are leaving it, and find their earthly affection changed into something holy as religion. And what is Time, to the married of Eternity?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid the tears of many, and a swell of exalted sentiment, in those who felt aright, was solemnized the union of two immortal souls. The train of withered mourners, the hoary bridegroom in his shroud, the pale features of the aged bride, and the death-bell tolling through the whole, till its deep voice overpowered the marriage words, all marked the funeral of earthly hopes. But as the ceremony proceeded, the organ, as if stirred by the sympathies of this impressive scene, poured forth an anthem, first mingling with the dismal knell, then rising to a loftier strain, till the soul looked down upon its woe. And when the awful rite was finished, and with cold hand in cold hand, the Married of Eternity withdrew, the organ's peal of solemn triumph drowned the Wedding Knell.\n",

      "\t\t\n",

      "Young Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem\n",
      "Village; but put his head back after crossing the threshold, to\n",
      "exchange a parting kiss with his young wife. And Faith, as the wife\n",
      "was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street,\n",
      "letting the wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she\n",
      "called to Goodman Brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dearest heart,\" whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her\n",
      "lips were close to his ear, \"prithee put off your journey until\n",
      "sunrise and sleep in your own bed to-night. A lone woman is\n",
      "troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of\n",
      "herself sometimes. Pray tarry with me this night, dear husband, of\n",
      "all nights in the year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love and my Faith,\" replied young Goodman Brown, \"of all nights\n",
      "in the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee. My\n",
      "journey, as thou callest it, forth and back again, must needs be\n",
      "done 'twixt now and sunrise. What, my sweet, pretty wife, cost thou\n",
      "doubt me already, and we but three months married?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then God bless you!\" said Faith, with the pink ribbons; \"and may\n",
      "you find all well when you come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amen!\" cried Goodman Brown. \"Say thy prayers, dear Faith, and go\n",
      "to bed at dusk, and no harm will come to thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they parted; and the young man pursued his way until, being\n",
      "about to turn the corner by the meeting-hduse, he looked back and\n",
      "saw the head of Faith still peeping after him with a melancholy\n",
      "air, in spite of her pink ribbons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little Faith!\" thought he, for his heart smote him. \"What a\n",
      "wretch am I to leave her on such an errand! She talks of dreams,\n",
      "too. Methought as she spoke there was trouble in her face, as if a\n",
      "dream had warned her what work is to be done to-night. But no, no;\n",
      "'t would kill her to think it. Well, she's a blessed angel on\n",
      "earth; and after this one night I'll cling to her skirts and follow\n",
      "her to heaven.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown felt\n",
      "himself justified in making more haste on his present evil purpose.\n",
      "He had taken a dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of\n",
      "the forest, which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep\n",
      "through, and closed immediately behind. It was all as lonely as\n",
      "could be; and there is this peculiarity in such a solitude, that\n",
      "the traveller knows not who may be concealed by the innumerable\n",
      "trunks and the thick boughs overhead; so that with lonely footsteps\n",
      "he may yet be passing through an unseen multitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree,\" said Goodman\n",
      "Brown to himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added,\n",
      "\"What if the devil himself should be at my very elbow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His head being turned back, he passed a crook of the road, and,\n",
      "looking forward again, beheld the figure of a man, in grave and\n",
      "decent attire, seated at the foot of an old tree. He arose at\n",
      "Goodman Brown's approach and walked onward side by side with him.\n",
      " \n",
      "\"You are late, Goodman Brown,\" said he. \"The clock of the Old South\n",
      "was striking as I came through Boston, and that is full fifteen\n",
      "minutes agone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Faith kept me back a while,\" replied the young man, with a tremor\n",
      "in his voice, caused by the sudden appearance of his companion,\n",
      "though not wholly unexpected.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now deep dusk in the forest, and deepest in that part of it\n",
      "where these two were journeying. As nearly as could be discerned,\n",
      "the second traveller was about fifty years old, apparently in the\n",
      "same rank of life as Goodman Brown, and bearing a considerable\n",
      "resemblance to him, though perhaps more in expression than\n",
      "features. Still they might have been taken for father and son. And\n",
      "yet, though the elder person was as simply clad as the younger, and\n",
      "as simple in manner too, he had an indescribable air of one who\n",
      "knew the world, and who would not have felt abashed at the\n",
      "governor's dinner table or in King William's court, were it\n",
      "possible that his affairs should call him thither. But the only\n",
      "thing about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his\n",
      "staff, which bore the likeness of a great black snake, so curiously\n",
      "wrought that it might almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself\n",
      "like a living serpent. This, of course, must have been an ocular\n",
      "deception, assisted by the uncertain light.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, Goodman Brown,\" cried his fellow-traveller, \"this is a dull\n",
      "pace for the beginning of a journey. Take my staff, if you are so\n",
      "soon weary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend,\" said the other, exchanging his slow pace for a full stop,\n",
      "\"having kept covenant by meeting thee here, It IS my purpose now to\n",
      "return whence I came. I have scruples touching the matter thou\n",
      "wot'st of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sayest thou so?\" replied he of the serpent, smiling apart. \"Let us\n",
      "walk on, nevertheless, reasoning as we go; and if I convince thee\n",
      "not thou shalt turn back. We are but a little way in the forest\n",
      "yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too far! too far!\" exclaimed the goodman, unconsciously resuming\n",
      "his walk. \"My father never went into the woods on such an errand,\n",
      "nor his father before him. We have been a race of honest men and\n",
      "good Christians since the days of the martyrs; and shall I be the\n",
      "first of the name of Brown that ever took this path and kept--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such company, thou wouldst say,\" observed the elder person,\n",
      "interpreting his pause. \"Well said, Goodman Brown! I have been as\n",
      "well acquainted with your family as with ever a one among the\n",
      "Puritans; and that's no trifle to say. I helped your grandfather,\n",
      "the constable, when he lashed the Quaker woman so smartly through\n",
      "the streets of Salem; and it was I that brought your father a\n",
      "pitch-pine knot, kindled at my own hearth, to set fire to an Indian\n",
      "village, in King Philip's war. They were my good friends, both; and\n",
      "many a pleasant walk have we had along this path, and returned\n",
      "merrily after midnight. I would fain be friends with you for their\n",
      "sake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it be as thou gayest,\" replied Goodman Brown, \"I marvel they\n",
      "never spoke of these matters; or, verily, I marvel not, seeing that\n",
      "the least rumor of the sort would have driven them from New\n",
      "England. We are a people of prayer, and good works to boot, and\n",
      "abide no such wickedness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wickedness or not,\" said the traveller with the twisted staff, \"I\n",
      "have a very general acquaintance here in New England. The deacons\n",
      "of many a church have drunk the communion wine with me; the\n",
      "selectmen of divers towns make me their chairman; and a majority of\n",
      "the Great and General Court are firm supporters of my interest. The\n",
      "governor and I, too--But these are state secrets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can this be so?\" cried Goodman Brown, with a stare of amazement at\n",
      "his undisturbed companion. \"Howbeit, I have nothing to do with the\n",
      "governor and council; they have their own ways, and are no rule for\n",
      "a simple husbandman like me. But, were I to go on with thee, how\n",
      "should I meet the eye of that good old man, our minister, at Salem\n",
      "Village? Oh, his voice would make me tremble both Sabbath day and\n",
      "lecture day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far the elder traveller had listened with due gravity; but now\n",
      "burst into a fit of irrepressible mirth, shaking himself so\n",
      "violently that his snakelike staff actually seemed to wriggle in\n",
      "sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha! ha! ha!\" shouted he again and again; then composing himself,\n",
      "\"Well, go on, Goodman Brown, go on; but, prithee, don't kill me\n",
      "with laughing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, to end the matter at once,\" said Goodman Brown,\n",
      "considerably nettled, \"there is my wife, Faith. It would break her\n",
      "dear little heart; and I'd rather break my own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, if that be the case,\" answered the other, \"e'en go thy ways,\n",
      "Goodman Brown. I would not for twenty old women like the one\n",
      "hobbling before us that Faith should come to any harm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke he pointed his staff at a female figure on the path, in\n",
      "whom Goodman Brown recognized a very pious and exemplary dame, who\n",
      "had taught him his catechism in youth, and was still his moral and\n",
      "spiritual adviser, jointly with the minister and Deacon Gookin.  \n",
      "\"A marvel, truly, that Goody Cloyse should be so far in the\n",
      "wilderness at nightfall,\" said he. \"But with your leave, friend, I\n",
      "shall take a cut through the woods until we have left this\n",
      "Christian woman behind. Being a stranger to you, she might ask whom\n",
      "I was consorting with and whither I was going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be it so,\" said his fellow-traveller. \"Betake you the woods' and\n",
      "let me keep the path.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly the young man turned aside, but took care to watch his\n",
      "companion, who advanced softly along the road until he had come\n",
      "within a staff's length of the old dame. She, meanwhile, was making\n",
      "the best of her way, with singular speed for so aged a woman, and\n",
      "mumbling some indistinct words--a prayer, doubtless--as she went.\n",
      "The traveller put forth his staff and touched her withered neck\n",
      "with what seemed the serpent's tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The devil!\" screamed the pious old lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then Goody Cloyse knows her old friend?\" observed the traveller,\n",
      "confronting her and leaning on his writhing stick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, forsooth, and is it your worship indeed?\" cried the good dame.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yea, truly is it, and in the very image of my old gossip, Goodman\n",
      "Brown, the grandfather of the silly fellow that now is. But--would\n",
      "your worship believe it?--my broomstick hath strangely disappeared,\n",
      "stolen, as I suspect, by that unhanged witch, Goody Cory, and that,\n",
      "too, when I was all anointed with the juice of smallage, and\n",
      "cinquefoil, and wolf's bane--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe,\" said the\n",
      "shape of old Goodman Brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, your worship knows the recipe,\" cried the old lady, cackling\n",
      "aloud. \"So, as I was saying, being all ready for the meeting, and\n",
      "no horse to ride on, I made up my mind to foot it; for they tell me\n",
      "there is a nice young man to be taken into communion to-night. But\n",
      "now your good worship will lend me your arm, and we shall be there\n",
      "in a twinkling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That can hardly be,\" answered her friend. \"I may not spare you my\n",
      "arm, Goody Cloyse; but here is my staff, if you will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he threw it down at her feet, where, perhaps, it assumed\n",
      "life, being one of the rods which its owner had formerly lent to\n",
      "the Egyptian magi. Of this fact, however, Goodman Brown could not\n",
      "take cognizance. He had cast up his eyes in astonishment, and,\n",
      "looking down again, beheld neither Goody Cloyse nor the serpentine\n",
      "staff, but this fellow-traveller alone, who waited for him as\n",
      "calmly as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That old woman taught me my catechism,\" said the young man; and\n",
      "there was a world of meaning in this simple comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "They continued to walk onward, while the elder traveller exhorted\n",
      "his companion to make good speed and persevere in the path,\n",
      "discoursing so aptly that his arguments seemed rather to spring up\n",
      "in the bosom of his auditor than to be suggested by himself. As\n",
      "they went, he plucked: a branch of maple to serve for a walking\n",
      "stick, and began to strip it of the twigs and little boughs, which\n",
      "were wet with evening dew. The moment his fingers touched them they\n",
      "became strangely withered and dried up as with a week's sunshine.\n",
      "Thus the pair proceeded, at a good free pace, until suddenly, in a\n",
      "gloomy hollow of the road, Goodman Brown sat himself down on the\n",
      "stump of a tree and refused to go any farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend,\" said he, stubbornly, \"my mind is made up. Not another\n",
      "step will I budge on this errand. What if a wretched old woman do\n",
      "choose to go to the devil when I thought she was going to heaven:\n",
      "is that any reason why I should quit my dear Faith and go after\n",
      "her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will think better of this by and by,\" said his acquaintance,\n",
      "composedly. \"Sit here and rest yourself a while; and when you feel\n",
      "like moving again, there is my staff to help you along.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without more words, he threw his companion the maple stick, and was\n",
      "as speedily out of sight as if he had vanished into the deepening\n",
      "gloom. The young man sat a few moments by the roadside, applauding\n",
      "himself greatly, and thinking with how clear a conscience he should\n",
      "meet the minister in his morning walk, nor shrink from the eye of\n",
      "good old Deacon Gookin. And what calm sleep would be his that very\n",
      "night, which was to have been spent so wickedly, but so purely and\n",
      "sweetly now, in the arms of Faith! Amidst these pleasant and\n",
      "praiseworthy meditations, Goodman Brown heard the tramp of horses\n",
      "along the road, and deemed it advisable to conceal himself within\n",
      "the verge of the forest, conscious of the guilty purpose that had\n",
      "brought him thither, though now so happily turned from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On came the hoof tramps and the voices of the riders, two grave old\n",
      "voices, conversing soberly as they drew near. These mingled sounds\n",
      "appeared to pass along the road, within a few yards of the young\n",
      "man's hiding-place; but, owing doubtless to the depth of the gloom\n",
      "at that particular spot, neither the travellers nor their steeds\n",
      "were visible. Though their figures brushed the small boughs by the\n",
      "wayside, it could not be seen that they intercepted, even for a\n",
      "moment, the faint gleam from the strip of bright sky athwart which\n",
      "they must have passed. Goodman Brown alternately crouched and stood\n",
      "on tiptoe, pulling aside the branches and thrusting forth his head\n",
      "as far as he durst without discerning so much as a shadow. It vexed\n",
      "him the more, because he could have sworn, were such a thing\n",
      "possible, that he recognized the voices of the minister and Deacon\n",
      "Gookin, jogging along quietly, as they were wont to do, when bound\n",
      "to some ordination or ecclesiastical council. While yet within\n",
      "hearing, one of the riders stopped to pluck a switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of the two, reverend sir,\" said the voice like the deacon's, \"I\n",
      "had rather miss an ordination dinner than to-night's meeting. They\n",
      "tell me that some of our community are to be here from Falmouth and\n",
      "beyond, and others from Connecticut and Rhode Island, besides\n",
      "several of the Indian powwows, who, after their fashion, know\n",
      "almost as much deviltry as the best of us. Moreover, there is a\n",
      "goodly young woman to be taken into communion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mighty well, Deacon Gookin!\" replied the solemn old tones of the\n",
      "minister. \"Spur up, or we shall be late. Nothing can be done, you\n",
      "know, until I get on the ground.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hoofs clattered again; and the voices, talking so strangely in\n",
      "the empty air, passed on through the forest, where no church had\n",
      "ever been gathered or solitary Christian prayed. Whither, then,\n",
      "could these holy men be journeying so deep into the heathen\n",
      "wilderness? Young Goodman Brown caught hold of a tree for support,\n",
      "being ready to sink down on the ground, faint and overburdened with\n",
      "the heavy sickness of his heart. He looked up to the sky, doubting\n",
      "whether there really was a heaven above him. Yet there was the blue\n",
      "arch, and the stars brightening in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With heaven above and Faith below, I will yet stand firm against\n",
      "the devil!\" cried Goodman Brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he still gazed upward into the deep arch of the firmament and\n",
      "had lifted his hands to pray, a cloud, though no wind was stirring,\n",
      "hurried across the zenith and hid the brightening stars. The blue\n",
      "sky was still visible, except directly overhead, where this black\n",
      "mass of cloud was sweeping swiftly northward. Aloft in the air, as\n",
      "if from the depths of the cloud, came a confused and doubtful sound\n",
      "of voices. Once the listener fancied that he could distinguish the\n",
      "accents of towns-people of his own, men and women, both pious and\n",
      "ungodly, many of whom he had met at the communion table, and had\n",
      "seen others rioting at the tavern. The next moment, so indistinct\n",
      "were the sounds, he doubted whether he had heard aught but the\n",
      "murmur of the old forest, whispering without a wind. Then came a\n",
      "stronger swell of those familiar tones, heard daily in the sunshine\n",
      "at Salem Village, but never until now from a cloud of night. There\n",
      "was one voice, of a young woman, uttering lamentations, yet with an\n",
      "uncertain sorrow, and entreating for some favor, which, perhaps, it\n",
      "would grieve her to obtain; and all the unseen multitude, both\n",
      "saints and sinners, seemed to encourage her onward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Faith!\" shouted Goodman Brown, in a voice of agony and\n",
      "desperation; and the echoes of the forest mocked him, crying,\n",
      "\"Faith! Faith!\" as if bewildered wretches were seeking her all\n",
      "through the wilderness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cry of grief, rage, and terror was yet piercing the night, when\n",
      "the unhappy husband held his breath for a response. There was a\n",
      "scream, drowned immediately in a louder murmur of voices, fading\n",
      "into far-off laughter, as the dark cloud swept away, leaving the\n",
      "clear and silent sky above Goodman Brown. But something fluttered\n",
      "lightly down through the air and caught on the branch of a tree.\n",
      "The young man seized it, and beheld a pink ribbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Faith is gone!\" cried he, after one stupefied moment. \"There is\n",
      "no good on earth; and sin is but a name. Come, devil; for to thee\n",
      "is this world given.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, maddened with despair, so that he laughed loud and long, did\n",
      "Goodman Brown grasp his staff and set forth again, at such a rate\n",
      "that he seemed to fly along the forest path rather than to walk or\n",
      "run. The road grew wilder and drearier and more faintly traced, and\n",
      "vanished at length, leaving him in the heart of the dark\n",
      "wilderness, still rushing onward with the instinct that guides\n",
      "mortal man to evil. The whole forest was peopled with frightful\n",
      "sounds--the creaking of the trees, the howling of wild beasts, and\n",
      "the yell of Indians; while sometimes the wind tolled like a distant\n",
      "church bell, and sometimes gave a broad roar around the traveller,\n",
      "as if all Nature were laughing him to scorn. But he was himself the\n",
      "chief horror of the scene, and shrank not from its other horrors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha! ha! ha!\" roared Goodman Brown when the wind laughed at him\n",
      "\"Let us hear which will laugh loudest. Think not to frighten me\n",
      "with your deviltry. Come witch, come wizard, come Indian powwow,\n",
      "come devil himself, and here comes Goodman Brown. You may as well\n",
      "fear him as he fear you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, all through the haunted forest there could be nothing\n",
      "more frightful than the figure of Goodman Brown. On he flew among\n",
      "the black pines, brandishing his staff with frenzied gestures, now\n",
      "giving vent to an inspiration of horrid blasphemy, and now shouting\n",
      "forth such laughter as set all the echoes of the forest laughing\n",
      "like demons around him. The fiend in his own shape is less hideous\n",
      "than when he rages in the breast of man. Thus sped the demoniac on\n",
      "his course, until, quivering among the trees, he saw a red light\n",
      "before him, as when the felled trunks and branches of a clearing\n",
      "have been set on fire, and throw up their lurid blaze against the\n",
      "sky, at the hour of midnight. He paused, in a lull of the tempest\n",
      "that had driven him onward, and heard the swell of what seemed a\n",
      "hymn, rolling solemnly from a distance with the weight of many\n",
      "voices. He knew the tune; it was a familiar one in the choir of the\n",
      "village meetinghouse. The verse died heavily away, and was\n",
      "lengthened by a chorus, not of human voices, but of all the sounds\n",
      "of the benighted wilderness pealing in awful harmony together.\n",
      "Goodman Brown cried out, and his cry was lost to his own ear by its\n",
      "unison with the cry of the desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the interval of silence he stole forward until the light glared\n",
      "full upon his eyes. At one extremity of an open space, hemmed in by\n",
      "the dark wall of the forest, arose a rock, bearing some rude,\n",
      "natural resemblance either to an altar or a pulpit, and surrounded\n",
      "by four blazing pines, their tops aflame, their stems untouched,\n",
      "like candles at an evening meeting. The mass of foliage that had\n",
      "overgrown the summit of the rock was all on fire, blazing high into\n",
      "the night and fitfully illuminating the whole field. Each pendent\n",
      "twig and leafy festoon was in a blaze. As the red light arose and\n",
      "fell' a numerous congregation alternately shone forth, then\n",
      "disappeared in shadow, and again grew, as it were, out of the\n",
      "darkness, peopling the heart of the solitary woods at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A grave and dark-clad company,\" quoth Goodman Brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth they were such. Among them, quivering to and fro between\n",
      "gloom and splendor, appeared faces that would be seen next day at\n",
      "the council board of the province, and others which, Sabbath after\n",
      "Sabbath, looked devoutly heavenward, and benignantly over the\n",
      "crowded pews, from the holiest pulpits in the land. Some affirm\n",
      "that the lady of the governor was there. At least there were high\n",
      "dames well known to her, and wives of honored husbands, and widows,\n",
      "a great multitude, and ancient maidens, all of excellent repute,\n",
      "and fair young girls, who trembled lest their mothers should espy\n",
      "them. Either the sudden gleams of light flashing over the obscure\n",
      "field bedazzled Goodman Brown, or he recognized a score of the\n",
      "church members of Salem Village famous for their especial sanctity.\n",
      "Good old Deacon Gookin had arrived, and waited at the skirts of\n",
      "that venerable saint, his revered pastor. But, irreverently\n",
      "consorting with these grave, reputable, and pious people, these\n",
      "elders of the church, these chaste dames and dewy virgins, there\n",
      "were men of dissolute lives and women of spotted fame, wretches\n",
      "given over to all mean and filthy vice, and suspected even of\n",
      "horrid crimes. It was strange to see that the good shrank not from\n",
      "the wicked, nor were the sinners abashed by the saints. Scattered\n",
      "also among their pale-faced enemies were the Indian priests, or\n",
      "powwows, who had often scared their native forest with more hideous\n",
      "incantations than any known to English witchcraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But where is Faith?\" thought Goodman Brown; and, as hope came into\n",
      "his heart, he trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another verse of the hymn arose, a slow and mournful strain, such\n",
      "as the pious love, but joined to words which expressed all that our\n",
      "nature can conceive of sin, and darkly hinted at far more.\n",
      "Unfathomable to mere mortals is the lore of fiends. Verse after\n",
      "verse was sung, and still the chorus of the desert swelled between\n",
      "like the deepest tone of a mighty organ; and with the final peal of\n",
      "that dreadful anthem there came a sound, as if the roaring wind,\n",
      "the rushing streams, the howling beasts, and every other voice of\n",
      "the unconcerted wilderness were mingling and according with the\n",
      "voice of guilty man in homage to the prince of all. The four\n",
      "blazing pines threw up a loftier flame, and obscurely discovered\n",
      "shapes and visages of horror on the smoke wreaths above the impious\n",
      "assembly. At the same moment the fire on the rock shot redly forth\n",
      "and formed a glowing arch above its base, where now appeared a\n",
      "figure. With reverence be it spoken, the figure bore no slight\n",
      "similitude, both in garb and manner, to some grave divine of the\n",
      "New England churches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring forth the converts!\" cried a voice that echoed through the\n",
      "field and rolled into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the word, Goodman Brown stepped forth from the shadow of the\n",
      "trees and approached the congregation, with whom he felt a loathful\n",
      "brotherhood by the sympathy of all that was wicked in his heart. He\n",
      "could have well-nigh sworn that the shape of his own dead father\n",
      "beckoned him to advance, looking downward from a smoke wreath,\n",
      "while a woman, with dim features of despair, threw out her hand to\n",
      "warn him back. Was it his mother? But he had no power to retreat\n",
      "one step, nor to resist, even in thought, when the minister and\n",
      "good old Deacon Gookin seized his arms and led him to the blazing\n",
      "rock. Thither came also the slender form of a veiled female, led\n",
      "between Goody Cloyse, that pious teacher of the catechism, and\n",
      "Martha Carrier, who had received the devil's promise to be queen of\n",
      "hell. A rampant hag was she. And there stood the proselytes beneath\n",
      "the canopy of fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Welcome, my children,\" said the dark figure, \"to the communion of\n",
      "your race. Ye have found thus young your nature and your destiny.\n",
      "My children, look behind you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned; and flashing forth, as it were, in a sheet of flame,\n",
      "the fiend worshippers were seen; the smile of welcome gleamed\n",
      "darkly on every visage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" resumed the sable form, \"are all whom ye have reverenced\n",
      "from youth. Ye deemed them holier than yourselves, and shrank from\n",
      "your own sin, contrasting it with their lives of righteousness and\n",
      "prayerful aspirations heavenward. Yet here are they all in my\n",
      "worshipping assembly. This night it shall be granted you to know\n",
      "their secret deeds: how hoary-bearded elders of the church have\n",
      "whispered wanton words to the young maids of their households; how\n",
      "many a woman, eager for widows' weeds, has given her husband a\n",
      "drink at bedtime and let him sleep his last sleep in her bosom how\n",
      "beardless youths have made haste to inherit their fathers' wealth;\n",
      "and how fair damsels--blush not, sweet ones--have dug little graves\n",
      "in the carder, and bidden me, the sole guest, to an infant's\n",
      "funeral. By the sympathy of your human hearts for sin ye shall\n",
      "scent out all the places--whether in church, bed-chamber, street,\n",
      "field, or forest--where crime has been committed, and shall exult\n",
      "to behold the whole earth one stain of guilt, one mighty blood\n",
      "spot. Far more than this. It shall be yours to penetrate, in every\n",
      "bosom, the deep mystery of sin, the fountain of all wicked arts,\n",
      "and which inexhaustibly supplies more evil impulses than human\n",
      "power--than my power at its utmost--can make manifest in deeds. And\n",
      "now, my children, look upon each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They did so; and, by the blaze of the hell-kindled torches, the\n",
      "wretched man beheld his Faith, and the wife her husband, trembling\n",
      "before that unhallowed altar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lo, there ye stand, my children,\" said the figure, in a deep and\n",
      "solemn tone, almost sad with its despairing awfulness, as if his\n",
      "once angelic nature could yet mourn for our miserable race.\n",
      "\"Depending upon one another's hearts, ye had still hoped that\n",
      "virtue were not all a dream. Now are ye undeceived. Evil is the\n",
      "nature of mankind. Evil must be your only happiness. Welcome again,\n",
      "my children, to the communion of your race.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Welcome,\" repeated the fiend worshippers, in one cry of despair\n",
      "and triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there they stood, the only pair, as it seemed, who were yet\n",
      "hesitating on the verge of wickedness in this dark world. A basin\n",
      "was hollowed, naturally, in the rock. Did it contain water,\n",
      "reddened by the lurid light? or was it blood? or, perchance, a\n",
      "liquid flame? Herein did the shape of evil dip his hand and prepare\n",
      "to lay the mark of baptism upon their foreheads, that they might be\n",
      "partakers of the mystery of sin, more conscious of the secret guilt\n",
      "of others, both in deed and thought, than they could now be of\n",
      "their own. The husband cast one look at his pale wife, and Faith at\n",
      "him. What polluted wretches would the next glance show them to each\n",
      "other, shuddering alike at what they disclosed and what they saw!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Faith! Faith!\" cried the husband, \"look up to heaven, and resist\n",
      "the wicked one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Faith obeyed he knew not. Hardly had he spoken when he\n",
      "found himself amid calm night and solitude, listening to a roar of\n",
      "the wind which died heavily away through the forest. He staggered\n",
      "against the rock, and felt it chill and damp; while a hanging twig,\n",
      "that had been all on fire, besprinkled his cheek with the coldest\n",
      "dew.\n",
      "\n",

      "The most disreputable thing in Yancey Goree's law office was Goree himself, sprawled in his creaky old arm-chair. The rickety little office, built of red brick, was set flush with the street -- the main street of the town of Bethel.\n",
      "Bethel rested upon the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge. Above it the mountains were piled to the sky. Far below it the turbid Catawba gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley.\n",
      "The June day was at its sultriest hour. Bethel dozed in the tepid shade. Trade was not. It was so still that Goree, reclining in his chair, distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the grand-jury room, where the \"court- house gang\" was playing poker. From the open back door of the office a well-worn path meandered across the grassy lot to the court-house. The treading out of that path had cost Goree all he ever had -- first inheritance of a few thousand dollars, next the old family home, and, latterly the last shreds of his self-respect and manhood. The \"gang\" had cleaned him out. The broken gambler had turned drunkard and parasite; he had lived to see this day come when the men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game. His word was no longer to be taken. The daily bouts at cards had arranged itself accordingly, and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the onlooker. The sheriff, the county clerk, a sportive deputy, a gay attorney, and a chalk-faced man hailing \"from the valley,\" sat at table, and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow more wool.\n",
      "Soon wearying of his ostracism, Goree had departed for his office, muttering to himself as he unsteadily traversed the unlucky pathway. After a drink of corn whiskey from a demijohn under the table, he had flung himself into the chair, staring, in a sort of maudlin apathy, out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze. The little white patch he saw away up on the side of Blackjack was Laurel, the village near which he had been born and bred. There, also, was the birthplace of the feud between the Gorees and the Coltranes. Now no direct heir of the Gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of misfortune. To the Coltranes, also, but one male supporter was left -- Colonel Abner Coltrane, a man of substance and standing, a member of the State Legislature, and a contemporary with Goree's father. The feud had been a typical one of the region; it had left a red record of hate, wrong and slaughter. But Yancey Goree was not thinking of feuds. His befuddled brain was hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself and his favourite follies. Of late, old friends of the family had seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place to sleep -- but whiskey they would not buy for him, and he must have whiskey. His law business was extinct; no case had been intrusted to him in two years. He had been a borrower and a sponge, and it seemed that if he fell no lower it would be from lack of opportunity. One more chance -- he was saying to himself -- if he had one more stake at the game, he thought he could win; but he had nothing left to sell, and his credit was more than exhausted.\n",
      "He could not help smiling, even in his misery, as he thought of the man to whom, six months before, he had sold the old Goree homestead. There had come from \"back yan'\" in the mountains two of the strangest creatures, a man named Pike Garvey and his wife. \"Back yan',\" with a wave of the hand toward the hills, was understood among the mountaineers to designate the remotest fastnesses, the unplumbed gorges, the haunts of lawbreakers, the wolf's den, and the boudoir of the bear. In the cabin far up on Blackjack's shoulder, in the wildest part of these retreats, this odd couple had lived for twenty years. They had neither dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the hills. Pike Garvey was little known in the settlements, but all who had dealt with him pronounced him \"crazy as a loon.\" He acknowledged no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter, but he \"moonshined\" occasionally by way of diversion. Once the \"revenues\" had dragged him from his lair, fighting silently and desperately like a terrier, and he had been sent to state's prison for two years. Released, he popped back into his hole like an angry weasel.\n",
      "Fortune, passing over many anxious wooers, made a freakish flight into Blackjack's bosky pockets to smile upon Pike and his faithful partner.\n",
      "One day a party of spectacled, knickerbockered, and altogether absurd prospectors invaded the vicinity of the Garvey's cabin. Pike lifted his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took a shot at them at long range on the chance of their being revenues. Happily he missed, and the unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer, disclosing their innocence of anything resembling law or justice. Later on, they offered the Garveys an enormous quantity of ready, green, crisp money for their thirty-acre patch of cleared land, mentioning, as an excuse for such a mad action, some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a bed of mica underlying the said property.\n",
      "When the Garveys became possessed of so many dollars that they faltered in computing them, the deficiencies of life on Blackjack began to grow prominent. Pike began to talk of new shoes, a hogshead of tobacco to set in the corner, a new lock to his rifle; and, leading Martella to a certain spot on the mountain-side, he pointed out to her how a small cannon -- doubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their fortune in price -- might be planted so as to command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin, to the confusion of revenues and meddling strangers forever.\n",
      "But Adam reckoned without his Eve. These things represented to him the applied power of wealth, but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition that soared far above his primitive wants. Somewhere in Mrs. Garvey's bosom still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty years of Blackjack. For so long a time the sounds in her ears had been the scaly-barks dropping in the woods at noon, and the wolves singing among the rocks at night, and it was enough to have purged her of vanities. She had grown fat and sad and yellow and dull. But when the means came, she felt a rekindled desire to assume the perquisites of her sex -- to sit at tea tables; to buy futile things; to whitewash the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony. So she coldly vetoed Pike's proposed system of fortifications, and announced that they would descend upon the world, and gyrate socially.\n",
      "And thus, at length, it was decided, and the thing done. The village of Laurel was their compromise between Mrs. Garvey's preference for one of the large valley towns and Pike's hankering for primeval solitudes. Laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social distractions comportable with Martella's ambitions, and was not entirely without recommendation to Pike, its contiguity to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable society should make it advisable.\n",
      "Their descent upon Laurel had been coincident with Yancey Goree's feverish desire to convert property into cash, and they bought the old Goree homestead, paying four thousand dollars ready money into the spendthrift's shaking hands.\n",
      "Thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the Gorees sprawled in his disreputable office, at the end of his row, spurned by the cronies whom he had gorged, strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers.\n",
      "A cloud of dust was rolling, slowly up the parched street, with something travelling in the midst of it. A little breeze wafted the cloud to one side, and a new, brightly painted carryall, drawn by a slothful gray horse, became visible. The vehicle deflected from the middle of the street as it neared Goree's office, and stopped in the gutter directly in front of his door.\n",
      "On the front seat sat a gaunt, tall man, dressed in black broadcloth, his rigid hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves. On the back seat was a lady who triumphed over the June heat. Her stout form was armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as \"changeable,\" being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues. She sat erect, waving a much-ornamented fan, with her eyes fixed stonily far down the street. However Martella Garvey's heart might be rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life, Blackjack had done his work with her exterior. He had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and inanity; had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags, and the reserve of his hushed interiors. She always seemed to hear, whatever her surroundings were, the scaly-barks falling and pattering down the mountainside. She could always hear the awful silence of Blackjack sounding through the stillest of nights.\n",
      "Goree watched this solemn equipage, as it drove to his door, with only faint interest; but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his whip, awkwardly descended, and stepped into the office, he rose unsteadily to receive him, recognizing Pike Garvey, the new, the transformed, the recently civilized.\n",
      "The mountaineer took the chair Goree offered him. They who cast doubts upon Garvey's soundness of mind had a strong witness in the man's countenance. His face was too long, a dull saffron in hue, and immobile as a statue's. Pale-blue, unwinking round eyes without lashes added to the singularity of his gruesome visage. Goree was at a loss to account for the visit.\n",
      "\"Everything all right at Laurel, Mr. Garvey?\" he inquired.\n",
      "\"Everything all right, sir, and mighty pleased is Missis Garvey and me with the property. Missis Garvey likes yo' old place, and she likes the neighbourhood. Society is what she 'lows she wants, and she is getting' of it. The Rogerses, the Hapgoods, the Pratts and the Troys hev been to see Missis Garvey, and she hev et meals to most of thar houses. The best folks hev axed her to differ'nt kinds of doin's. I cyan't say, Mr. Goree, that sech things suits me -- fur me, give me them thar.\" Garvey's huge, yellow-gloved hand flourished in the direction of the mountains. \"That's whar I b'long, 'mongst the wild honey bees and the b'ars. But that ain't what I come fur to say, Mr. Goree. Thar's somethin' you got what me and Missis Garvey wants to buy.\"\n",
      "\"Buy!\" echoed Goree. \"From me?\" Then he laughed harshly. \"I reckon you are mistaken about that. I reckon you are mistaken about that. I sold out to you, as you yourself expressed it, 'lock, stock and barrel.' There isn't even a ramrod left to sell.\"\n",
      "\"You've got it; and we 'uns want it. 'Take the money,' says Missis Garvey, 'and buy it fa'r and squared'.'\"\n",
      "Goree shook his head. \"The cupboard's bare,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We've riz,\" pursued the mountaineer, undetected from his object, \"a heap. We was pore as possums, and now we could hev folks to dinner every day. We been recognized, Missis Garvey says, by the best society. But there's somethin' we need we ain't got. She says it ought to been put in the 'ventory ov the sale, but it tain't thar. 'Take the money, then,' says she, 'and buy it fa'r and squar'.\"'\n",
      "\"Out with it,\" said Goree, his racked nerves growing impatient.\n",
      "Garvey threw his slouch bat upon the table, and leaned forward, fixing his unblinking eyes upon Goree's.\n",
      "\"There's a old feud,\" he said distinctly and slowly, \"'tween you 'uns and the Coltranes.\"\n",
      "Goree frowned ominously. To speak of his feud to a feudist is a serious breach of the mountain etiquette. The man from \"back yan'\" knew it as well as the lawyer did.\n",
      "\"Na offense,\" he went on \"but purely in the way of business. Missis Garvey hev studied all about feuds. Most of the quality folks in the mountains hev 'em. The Settles and the Goforths, the Rankins and the Boyds, the Silers and the Galloways, hev all been cyarin' on feuds f'om twenty to a hundred year. The last man to drap was when yo' uncle, Jedge Paisley Goree, 'journed co't and shot Len Coltrane f'om the bench. Missis Garvey and me, we come f'om the po' white trash. Nobody wouldn't pick a feud with we 'uns, no mo'n with a fam'ly of tree-toads. Quality people everywhar, says Missis Garvey, has feuds. We 'uns ain't quality, but we're uyin' into it as fur as we can. 'Take the money, then,' says Missis Garvey, 'and buy Mr. Goree's feud, fa'r and squar'.'\"\n",
      "The squirrel hunter straightened a leg half across the room, drew a roll of bills from his pocket, and threw them on the table.\n",
      "\"Thar's two hundred dollars, Mr. Goree; what you would call a fa'r price for a feud that's been 'lowed to run down like yourn hev. Thar's only you left to cyar' on yo' side of it, and you'd make mighty po' killin'. I'll take it off yo' hands, and it'll set me and Missis Garvey up among the quality. Thar's the money.\"\n",
      "The little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself, writhing and jumping as its folds relaxed. In the silence that followed Garvey's last speech the rattling of the poker chips in the court-house could be plainly heard. Goree knew that the sheriff had just won a pot, for the subdued whoop with which he always greeted a victory floated across the square upon the crinkly heat waves. Beads of moisture stood on Goree's brow. Stooping, he drew the wicker-covered demijohn from under the table, and filled a tumbler from it.\n",
      "\"A little corn liquor, Mr. Garvey? Of course you are joking about what you spoke of? Opens quite a new market, doesn't it? Feuds. Prime, two-fifty to three. Feuds, slightly damaged -- two hundred, I believe you said, Mr. Garvey?\"\n",
      "Goree laughed self-consciously.\n",
      "The mountaineer took the glass Goree handed him, and drank the whisky without a tremor of the lids of his staring eyes. The lawyer applauded the feat by a look of envious admiration. He poured his own drink, and took it like a drunkard, by gulps, and with shudders at the smell and taste.\n",
      "\"Two hundred,\" repeated Garvey. \"Thar's the money.\"\n",
      "A sudden passion flared up in Goree's brain. He struck the table with his fist. One of the bills flipped over and touched his hand. He flinched as if something had stung him.\n",
      "\"Do you come to me,\" he shouted, \"seriously with such a ridiculous, insulting, darned-fool proposition?\"\n",
      "\"It's fa'r and squar',\" said the squirrel hunter, but he reached out his hand as if to take back the money; and then Goree knew that his own flurry of rage had not been from pride or resentment, but from anger at himself, knowing that he would set foot in the deeper depths that were being opened to him. He turned in an instant from an outraged gentleman to an anxious chafferer recommending his goods.\n",
      "\"Don't be in a hurry, Garvey,\" he said, his face crimson and his speech thick. \"I accept your p-p-proposition, though it's dirt cheap at two hundred. A t-trade's all right when both p-purchaser and b-buyer are s-satisfied. Shall I w-wrap it up for you, Mr. Garvey?\"\n",
      "Garvey rose, and shook out his broadcloth. \"Missis Garvev will be pleased. You air out of it, and it stands Coltrane and Garvey. Just a scrap ov writin', Mr. Goree, you bein' a lawyer, to show we traded.\"\n",
      "Goree seized a sheet of paper and a pen. The money was clutched in his moist hand. Everything else suddenly seemed to grow trivial and light.\n",
      "\"Bill of sale, by all means. 'Right, title, and interest in and to' . . . 'forever warrant and -- ' No, Garvey, we'll have to leave out that 'defend,'\" said Goree with a loud laugh. \"You'll have to defend this title yourself.\"\n",
      "The mountaineer received the amazing screed that the lawyer handed him, folded it with immense labour, and laced it carefully in his pocket.\n",
      "Goree was standing near the window. \"Step here, said, raising his finger, \"and I'll show you your recently purchased enemy. There he goes, down the other side of the street.\"\n",
      "The mountaineer crooked his long frame to look through the window in the direction indicated by the other. Colonel Abner Coltrane, an erect, portly gentleman of about fifty, wearing the inevitable long, double-breasted frock coat of the Southern lawmaker, and an old high silk hat, was passing on the opposite sidewalk. As Garvey looked, Goree glanced at his face. If there be such a thing as a yellow wolf, here was its counterpart. Garvey snarled as his unhuman eyes followed the moving figure, disclosing long, amber-coloured fangs.\n",
      "\"Is that him? Why, that's the man who sent me to the penitentiary once!\"\n",
      "\"He used to be district attorney,\" said Goree carelessly. \"And, by the way, he's a first-class shot.\"\n",
      "\"I kin hit a squirrel's eye at a hundred yard,\" said Garvey. \"So that thar's Coltrane! I made a better trade than I was thinkin'. I'll take keer ov this feud, Mr. Goree, better'n you ever did!\"\n",
      "He moved toward the door, but lingered there, betraying a slight perplexity.\n",
      "\"Anything else to-day?\" inquired Goree with frothy sarcasm. \"Any family traditions, ancestral ghosts, or skeletons in the closet? Prices as low as the lowest.\"\n",
      "\"Thar was another thing,\" replied the unmoved squirrel hunter, \"that Missis Garvey was thinkin' of. 'Tain't so much in my line as t'other, but she wanted partic'lar that I should inquire, and ef you was willin', 'pay fur it,' she says, 'fa'r and squar'.' Thar's a buryin' groun', as you know, Mr. Goree, in the yard of yo' old place, under the cedars. Them that lies thar is yo' folks what was killed by the Coltranes. The monyments has the names on 'em. Missis Garvev says a fam'ly buryin' groun'- is a sho' sign of quality. She says ef we git the feud thar's somethin' else ought to go with it. The names on them moiivments is 'Goree,' but they can be changed to ourn by -- \"\n",
      "\"Go. Go!\" screamed Goree, his face turning purple. He stretched out both hands toward the mountaineer, his fingers hooked and shaking. \"Go, you ghoul! Even a Ch-Chinaman protects the g-graves of his ancestors -- go!\"\n",
      "The squirrel hunter slouched out of the door to his carryall. While he was climbing over the wheel Goree was collecting, with feverish celerity, the money that had fallen from his hand to the floor. As the vehicle slowly turned about, the sheep, with a coat of newly grown wool, was hurrying, in indecent haste, along the path to the court-house.\n",
      "At three o'clock in the morning they brought him back to his office, shorn and unconscious. The sheriff, the sportive deputy, the county clerk, and the gay attorney carried him, the chalk-faced man \"from the valley\" acting as escort.\n",
      "\"On the table,\" said one of them, and they deposited him there among the litter of his unprofitable books and papers.\n",
      "\"Yance thinks a lot of a pair of deuces when he's liquored up,\" sighed the sheriff reflectively.\n",
      "\"Too much,\" said the gay attorney. \"A man has no business to play poker who drinks as much as he does. I wonder how much he dropped to-night.\"\n",
      "\"Close to two hundred. What I wonder is whar he got it. Yance ain't had a cent fur over a month, I know.\"\n",
      "\"Struck a client, maybe. Well, let's get home before daylight. He'll be all right when he wakes up, except for a sort of beehive about the cranium.\"\n",
      "The gang slipped away through the early morning twilight. The next eye to gaze upon the miserable Goree was the orb of day. He peered through the uncurtained window, first deluging the sleeper in a flood of faint gold, but soon pouring upon the mottled red of his flesh a searching, white, summer heat. Goree stirred, half unconsciously, among the table's dÃ©bris, and turned his face from the window. His movement dislodged a heavy law book, which crashed upon the floor. Opening his eyes, he saw, bending over him, a man in a black frock coat. Looking higher, he discovered a well-worn silk hat, and beneath it the kindly, smooth face of Colonel Abner Coltrane.\n",
      "A little uncertain of the outcome, the colonel waited for the other to make some sign of recognition. Not in twenty years had male members of these two families faced each other in peace. Goree's eyelids puckered as he strained his blurred sight toward this visitor, and then he smiled serenely.\n",
      "\"Have you brought Stella and Lucy over to play?\" he said calmly.\n",
      "\"Do you know me, Yancey?\" asked Coltrane.\n",
      "\"Of course I do. You brought me a whip with a whistle in the end.\"\n",
      "So he had -- twenty-four years ago; when Yancey's father was his best friend.\n",
      "Goree's eyes wandered about the room. The colonel understood. \"Lie still, and I'll bring you some,\" said he. There was a pump in the yard at the rear, and Goree closed his eyes, listening with rapture to the click of its handle, and the bubbling of the falling stream. Coltrane brought a pitcher of the cool water, and held it for him to drink. Presently Goree sat up -- a most forlorn object, his summer suit of flax soiled and crumpled, his discreditable head tousled and unsteady. He tried to wave one of his hands toward the colonel.\n",
      "\"Ex-excuse-everything, will you?\" he said. \"I must have drunk too much whiskey last night, and gone to bed on the table.\" His brows knitted into a puzzled frown.\n",
      "\"Out with the boys awhile?\" asked Coltrane kindly.\n",
      "\"No, I went nowhere. I haven't had a dollar to spend in the last two months. Struck the demijohn too often. I reckon, as usual.\"\n",
      "Colonel Coltrane touched him on the shoulder.\n",
      "\"A little while ago, Yancey,\" he began, \"you asked me if I had brought Stella and Lucy over to play. You weren't quite awake then, and must have been dreaming you were a boy again. You are awake now, and I want you to listen to me. I have come from Stella and Lucy to their old playmate, and to my old friend's son. They know that I am going to bring you home with me, and you will find them as ready with a welcome as they were in the old days. I want you to come to my house and stay until you are yourself again, and as much longer as you will. We heard of your being down in the world, and in the midst of temptation, and we agreed that you should come over and play at our house once more. Will you come, my boy? Will you drop our old family trouble and come with me?\"\n",
      "\"Trouble!\" said Goree, opening his eyes wide. \"There was never any trouble between us that I know of. I'm sure we've always been the best friends. But, good Lord, Colonel, how could I go to your home as I am -- a drunken wretch, a miserable, degraded spendthrift and gambler -- \"\n",
      "He lurched from the table into his armchair, and began to weep maudlin tears, mingled with genuine drops of remorse and shame. Coltrane talked to him persistently and reasonably, reminding him of the simple mountain pleasures of which he had once been so fond, and insisting upon the genuineness of the invitation.\n",
      "Finally he landed Goree by telling him he was counting upon his help in the engineering and transportation of a large amount of felled timber from a high mountain-side to a waterway. He knew that Goree had once invented a device for this purpose -- a series of slides and chutes- upon which he had justly prided himself. In an instant the poor fellow, delighted at the idea of his being of use to any one, had paper spread upon the table, and was drawing rapid but pitifully shaky lines in demonstration of what he could and would do.\n",
      "The man was sickened of the husks; his prodigal heart was turning again toward the mountains. His mind was yet strangely clogged, and his thoughts and memories were returning to his brain one by one, like carrier pigeons over a stormy sea. But Coltrane was satisfied with the progress he had made.\n",
      "Bethel received the surprise of its existence that afternoon when a Coltrane and a Goree rode amicably together through the town. Side by side they rode, out from the dusty streets and gaping townspeople, down across the creek bridge, and up toward the mountain. The prodigal had brushed and washed and combed himself to a more decent figure, but he was unsteady in the saddle, and he seemed to be deep in the contemplation of some vexing problem. Coltrane left him in his mood, relying upon the influence of changed surroundings to restore his equilibrium.\n",
      "Once Goree was seized with a shaking fit, and almost came to a collapse. He had to dismount and rest at the side of the road. The colonel, foreseeing such a condition, had provided a small flask of whisky for the journey but when it was offered to him Goree refused it almost with violence, declaring he would never touch it again. By and by he was recovered, and went quietly enough for a mile or two. Then he pulled up his horse suddenly, and said:\n",
      "\"I lost two hundred dollars last night, playing poker. Now, where did I get that money?\"\n",
      "\"Take it easy, Yancey. The mountain air will soon clear it up. We'll go fishing, first thing, at the Pinnacle Falls. The trout are jumping there like bullfrogs. We'll take Stella and Lucy along, and have a picnic on Eagle Rock. Have you forgotten how a hickory-cured-ham sandwich tastes, Yancey, to a hungry fisherman?\"\n",
      "Evidently the colonel did not believe the story of his lost wealth; so Goree retired again into brooding silence.\n",
      "By late Afternoon they had travelled ten of the twelve miles between Bethel and Laurel. Half a mile this side of Laurel lay the old Goree place; a mile or two beyond the village lived the Coltranes. The road was now steep and laborious, but the compensations were many. The tilted aisles of the forest were opulent with leaf and bird and bloom. The tonic air put to shame the pharmacopÃ¦ia. The glades were dark with mossy shade, and bright with shy rivulets winking from the ferns and laurels. On the lower side they viewed, framed in the near foilage, exquisite sketches of the far valley swooning in its opal haze.\n",
      "Coltrane was pleased to see that his companion was yielding to the spell of the hills and woods. For now they had but to skirt the base of Painter's Cliff; to cross Elder Branch and mount the hill beyond, and Goree would have to face the squandered home of his fathers. Every rock he passed, every tree, every foot of the rocky way, was familiar to him. Though he hid forgotten the woods, they thrilled him like the music of \"Home, Sweet Home.\"\n",
      "They rounded the cliff, decended into Elder Branch, and paused there to let the horses drink and splash in the swift water. On the right was a rail fence that cornered there, and followed the road and stream. Inclosed by it was the old apple orchard of the home place; the house was yet concealed by the brow of the steep hill. Inside and along the fence, pokeberries, elders, sassafras, and sumac grew high and dense. At a rustle of their branches, both Goree and Coltrane glanced up, and saw a long, yellow, wolfish face above the fence, staring at them with pale, unwinking eyes. The head quickly disappeared; there was a violent swaying of the bushes, and an ungainly figure ran up through the apple orchard in the direction of the house, zigzagging among the trees.\n",
      "\"That's Garvey,\" said Coltrane; \"the man you sold out to. There's no doubt but he's considerably cracked. I had to send him up for moonshining, once, several years ago, in spite of the fact that I believed him irresponsible. Why, what's the matter, Yancey?\"\n",
      "Goree was wiping his forehead, and his face had lost its colour. \"Do I look queer, too?\" he asked, trying to smile. \"I'm just remembering a few more things.\" Some of the alcohol had evaporated from his brain. \"I recollect now where I got that two hundred dollars.\"\n",
      "\"Don't think of it,\" said Coltrane cheerfully. \"Later on we'll figure it all out together.\"\n",
      "They rode out of the branch, and when they reached the foot of the hill Goree stopped again.\n",
      "\"Did you ever suspect I was a very vain kind of fellow, Colonel\" he asked. \"Sort of foolish proud about appearances?\"\n",
      "The colonel's eyes refused to wander to the soiled, sagging suit of flax and the faded slouch hat.\n",
      "\"It seems to me,\" he replied, mystified, but humouring him, \"I remember a young buck about twenty, with the tightest coat, the sleekest hair, and the prancingest saddle horse in the Blue Ridge.\"\n",
      "\"Right you are,\" said Goree eagerly. \"And it's in me yet, though it don't show. Oh, I'm as vain as a turkey gobbler, and as proud as Lucifer. I'm going to ask you to indulge this weakness of mine in a little matter.\"\n",
      "\"Speak out, Yancey. We'll create you Duke of Laurel and Baron of Blue Ridge, if you choose; and you shall have a feather out of Stella's peacock's tail to wear in your hat.\"\n",
      "\"I'm in earnest. In a few minutes we'll pass the house up there on the hill where I was born, and where my people have lived for nearly a century. Strangers live there now -- and look at me! I am about to show myself to them ragged and poverty-stricken, a wastrel and a beggar. Colonel Coltrane, I'm ashamed to do it. I want you to let me wear your coat and hat until we are out of sight beyond. I know you think it a foolish pride, but I want to make as good a showing as I can when I pass the old place.\"\n",
      "\"Now, what does this mean?\" said Coltrane to himself, as he compared his companion's sane looks and quiet demeanour with his strange request. But he was already unbuttoning the coat, assenting readily, as if the fancy were in no wise to be considered strange.\n",
      "The coat and hat fitted Goree well. He buttoned the former about him with a look of satisfaction and dignity. He and Coltrane were nearly the same size -- rather tall, portly, and erect. Twenty-five years were between them, but in appearance they might have been brothers. Goree looked older than his age; his face was puffy and lined; the colonel had the smooth, fresh complexion of a temperate liver. He put on Goree's disreputable old flax coat and faded slouch hat.\n",
      "\"Now,\" said Goree, taking up the reins, \"I'm all right. I want you to ride about ten feet in the rear as we go by, Colonel, so that they can get a good look at me. They'll see I'm no back number yet, by any means. I guess I'll show up pretty well to them once more, anyhow. Let's ride on.\"\n",
      "He set out up the hill at a smart trot, the colonel following, as he had been requested.\n",
      "Goree sat straight in the saddle, with head erect, but his eyes were turned to the right, sharply scanning every shrub and fence and hiding-place in the old homestead yard. Once he muttered to himself, \"Will the crazy fool try it, or did I dream half of it?\"\n",
      "It was when he came opposite the little family burying ground that he saw what he had been looking for -- a puff of white smoke, coming from the thick cedars in one corner. He toppled so slowly to the left that Coltrane had time to urge his horse to that side, and catch him with one arm.\n",
      "The squirrel hunter had not overpraised his aim. He had sent the bullet where he intended, and where Goree had expected that it would pass - through the breast of Colonel Abner Coltrane's black frock coat.\n",
      "Goree leaned heavily against Coltrane, but he did not fall. The horses kept pace, side by side, and the Colonel's arm kept him steady. The little white houses of Laurel shone through the trees, half a mile away. Goree reached out one hand and groped until it rested upon Coltrane's fingers, which held his bridle.\n",
      "\"Good friend,\" he said, and that was all.\n",
      "Thus did Yancey Goree, as be rode past his old home, make, considering all things, the best showing that was in his power.\n",

      "Every Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club gave a hop in the hall of the Give and Take Athletic Association on the East Side. In order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the Give and Take--or, if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing, you must work in Rhinegold's paper-box factory. Still, any Clover Leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance. But mostly each Give and Take brought the paper-box girl that he affected; and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops.\n",
      "Maggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left- handed style of footwork in the twostep, went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her \"fellow.\" Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory, and were the greatest chums ever. So Anna always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie's house every Saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them.\n",
      "The Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The hall of the association in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle-making inventions. With the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat. Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night hop with the paper-box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen. For sometimes the tip went 'round, and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter-weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes.\n",
      "On Saturdays Rhinegold's paper-box factory closed at 3 P. M. On one such afternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward together. At Maggie's door Anna said, as usual: \"Be ready at seven, sharp, Mag; and Jimmy and we'll come by for you.\"\n",
      "But what was this? Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non-escorted one there was to be perceived a high- poised head, a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth, and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye.\n",
      "\"Thanks, Anna,\" said Maggie; \"but you and Jimmy needn't bother to-night. I've a gentleman friend that's coming 'round to escort me to the hop.\"\n",
      "The comely Anna pounced upon her friend, shook her, chided and beseeched her. Maggie Toole catch a fellow! Plain, dear, loyal, unattractive Maggie, so sweet as a chum, so unsought for a two-step or a moonlit bench in the little park. How was it? When did it happen? Who was it?\n",
      "\"You'll see to-night,\" said Maggie, flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in Cupid's vineyard. \"He's swell all right. He's two inches taller than Jimmy, and an up-to-date dresser. I'll introduce him, Anna, just as soon as we get to the hall.\"\n",
      "Anna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening. Anna's eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend's \"catch.\"\n",
      "At 8:30 Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort. Quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy.\n",
      "\"Oh, gee!\" cried Anna, \"Mag ain't made a hit--oh, no! Swell fellow? well, I guess! Style? Look at 'um.\"\n",
      "\"Go as far as you like,\" said Jimmy, with sandpaper in his voice. \"Cop him out if you want him. These new guys always win out with the push. Don't mind me. He don't squeeze all the limes, I guess. Huh!\"\n",
      "\"Shut up, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I'm glad for Mag. First fellow she ever had. Oh, here they come.\"\n",
      "Across the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser. And truly, her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum. He stood two inches taller than the average Give and Take athlete; his dark hair curled; his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles. The young men of the Clover Leaf Club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess, its achievements in hand-to-hand conflicts, and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it. The member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brummel airs. They were not considered honourable methods of warfare. The swelling biceps, the coat straining at its buttons over the chest, the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation, even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of Cupid--these were the approved arms and ammunition of the Clover Leaf gallants. They viewed, then, genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle.\n",
      "\"A friend of mine, Mr. Terry O'Sullivan,\" was Maggie's formula of introduction. She led him around the room, presenting him to each new-arriving Clover Leaf. Almost was she pretty now, with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse.\n",
      "\"Maggie Toole's got a fellow at last,\" was the word that went round among the paper-box girls. \"Pipe Mag's floor-walker\"--thus the Give and Takes expressed their indifferent contempt.\n",
      "Usually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back. She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self- sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step.\n",
      "But to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six. Terry O'Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight. And though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose-crowned melody of Maggie's one perfect night.\n",
      "The girls besieged her for introductions to her \"fellow.\" The Clover Leaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole. They flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance.\n",
      "Thus she scored; but to Terry O'Sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast. He shook his curls; he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day. He danced like a faun; he introduced manner and style and atmosphere; his words came trippingly upon his tongue, and--he waltzed twice in succession with the paper- box girl that Dempsey Donovan brought.\n",
      "Dempsey was the leader of the association. He wore a dress suit, and could chin the bar twice with one hand. He was one of \"Big Mike\" O'Sullivan's lieutenants, and was never troubled by trouble. No cop dared to arrest him. Whenever be broke a pushcart man's head or shot a member of the Heinrick B. Sweeney Outing and Literary Association in the kneecap, an officer would drop around and say:\n",
      "\"The Cap'n 'd like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time, Dempsey, me boy.\"\n",
      "But there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars; and somebody would tell a funny story, and then Dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells. So, doing a tight-rope act on a wire stretched across Niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with Dempsey Donovan's paper-box girl. At 10 o'clock the jolly round face of \"Big Mike\" O'Sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene. He always looked in for five minutes, smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys.\n",
      "Dempsey Donovan was at his elbow instantly, talking rapidly. \"Big Mike\" looked carefully at the dancers, smiled, shook his head and departed.\n",
      "The music stopped. The dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls. Terry O'Sullivan, with his entrancing bow, relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find Maggie. Dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor.\n",
      "Some fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena. Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer.\n",
      "\"One moment, Mr. O'Sullivan,\" said Dempsey. \"I hope you're enjoying yourself. Where did you say you live?\"\n",
      "The two gladiators were well matched. Dempsey had, perhaps, ten pounds of weight to give away. The O'Sullivan had breadth with quickness. Dempsey had a glacial eye, a dominating slit of a mouth, an indestructible jaw, a complexion like a belle's and the coolness of a champion. The visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer. They were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten. They were each too splendid, too mighty, too incomparable to divide pre-eminence. One only must survive.\n",
      "\"I live on Grand,\" said O'Sullivan, insolently; \"and no trouble to find me at home. Where do you live?\"\n",
      "Dempsey ignored the question.\n",
      "\"You say your name's O'Sullivan,\" he went on. \"Well, 'Big Mike' says he never saw you before.\"\n",
      "\"Lots of things he never saw,\" said the favourite of the hop.\n",
      "\"As a rule,\" went on Dempsey, huskily sweet, \"O'Sullivans in this district know one another. You escorted one of our lady members here, and we want chance to make good. If you've got a family tree let's see a few historical O'Sullivan buds come out on it. Or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots?\"\n",
      "\"Suppose you mind your own business,\" suggested O'Sullivan, blandly.\n",
      "Dempsey's eye brightened. He held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him.\n",
      "\"I've got it now,\" he said cordially. \"It was just a little mistake. You ain't no O'Sullivan. You are a ring-tailed monkey. Excuse us for not recognising you at first.\"\n",
      "O'Sullivan's eye flashed. He made a quick movement, but Andy Geoghan was ready and caught his arm.\n",
      "Dempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan, the secretary of the club, and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall. Two other members of the Give and Take Association swiftly joined the little group. Terry O'Sullivan was now in the hands of the Board of Rules and Social Referees. They spoke to him briefly and softly, and conducted him out through the same door at the rear.\n",
      "This movement on the part of the Clover Leaf members requires a word of elucidation. Back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club. In this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled, man to man, with the weapons of nature, under the supervision of the board. No lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a Clover Leaf hop in several years. Its gentlemen members guaranteed that.\n",
      "So easily and smoothly had Dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating O'Sullivan's social triumph. Among these was Maggie. She looked about for her escort.\n",
      "\"Smoke up!\" said Rose Cassidy. \"Wasn't you on? Demps Donovan picked a scrap with your Lizzie-boy, and they've waltzed out to the slaughter room with him. How's my hair look done up this way, Mag?\"\n",
      "Maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist.\n",
      "\"Gone to fight with Dempsey!\" she said, breathlessly. \"They've got to be stopped. Dempsey Donovan can't fight him. Why, he'll--he'll kill him!\"\n",
      "\"Ah, what do you care?\" said Rosa. \"Don't some of 'em fight every hop?\"\n",
      "But Maggie was off, darting her zig-zag way through the maze of dancers. She burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat. It gave way, and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene--the Board standing about with open watches; Dempsey Donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing, light-footed, with the wary grace of the modern pugilist, within easy reach of his adversary; Terry O'Sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes. And without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream--leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of O'Sullivan that was suddenly uplifted, and to whisk from it the long, bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom.\n",
      "The knife fell and rang upon the floor. Cold steel drawn in the rooms of the Give and Take Association! Such a thing had never happened before. Every one stood motionless for a minute. Andy Geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously, like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning.\n",
      "And then O'Sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth. Dempsey and the board exchanged looks. And then Dempsey looked at O'Sullivan without anger, as one looks at a stray dog, and nodded his head in the direction of the door.\n",
      "\"The back stairs, Giuseppi,\" he said, briefly. \"Somebody'll pitch your hat down after you.\"\n",
      "Maggie walked up to Dempsey Donovan. There was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks, down which slow tears were running. But she looked him bravely in the eye.\n",
      "\"I knew it, Dempsey,\" she said, as her eyes grew dull even in their tears. \"I knew he was a Guinea. His name's Tony Spinelli. I hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin'. Them Guineas always carries knives. But you don't understand, Dempsey. I never had a fellow in my life. I got tired of comin' with Anna and Jimmy every night, so I fixed it with him to call himself O'Sullivan, and brought him along. I knew there'd be nothin' doin' for him if he came as a Dago. I guess I'll resign from the club now.\"\n",
      "Dempsey turned to Andy Geoghan.\n",
      "\"Chuck that cheese slicer out of the window,\" he said, \"and tell 'em inside that Mr. O'Sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to Tammany Hall.\"\n",
      "And then he turned back to Maggie.\n",
      "\"Say, Mag,\" he said, \"I'll see you home. And how about next Saturday night? Will you come to the hop with me if I call around for you?\"\n",
      "It was remarkable how quickly Maggie's eyes could change from dull to a shining brown.\n",
      "\"With you, Dempsey?\" she stammered. \"Say--will a duck swim?\"\n",

      "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\n",
      "There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\n",
      "While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad.\n",
      "In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name \"Mr. James Dillingham Young.\"\n",
      "The \"Dillingham\" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of \"Dillingham\" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called \"Jim\" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\n",
      "Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.\n",
      "There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\n",
      "Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\n",
      "Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\n",
      "So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\n",
      "On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the street.\n",
      "Where she stopped the sign read: \"Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.\" One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the \"Sofronie.\"\n",
      "\"Will you buy my hair?\" asked Della.\n",
      "\"I buy hair,\" said Madame. \"Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it.\"\n",
      "Down rippled the brown cascade.\n",
      "\"Twenty dollars,\" said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\n",
      "\"Give it to me quick\" said Della.\n",
      "Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.\n",
      "She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\n",
      "When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.\n",
      "Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\n",
      "\"If Jim doesn't kill me,\" she said to herself, \"before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?\"\n",
      "At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\n",
      "Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: \"Please, God, make him think I am still pretty.\"\n",
      "The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\n",
      "Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\n",
      "Della wriggled off the table and went for him.\n",
      "\"Jim, darling,\" she cried, \"don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for you.\"\n",
      "\"You've cut off your hair?\" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.\n",
      "\"Cut it off and sold it,\" said Della. \"Don't you like me just as well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?\"\n",
      "Jim looked about the room curiously.\n",
      "\"You say your hair is gone?\" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\n",
      "\"You needn't look for it,\" said Della. \"It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,\" she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, \"but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?\"\n",
      "Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\n",
      "Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\n",
      "\"Don't make any mistake, Dell,\" he said, \"about me. I don't think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.\"\n",
      "White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\n",
      "For there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.\n",
      "But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: \"My hair grows so fast, Jim!\"\n",
      "And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, \"Oh, oh!\"\n",
      "Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\n",
      "\"Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.\"\n",
      "Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.\n",
      "\"Dell,\" said he, \"let's put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy Your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.\"\n",
      "The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.\n",

      "In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called \"places.\" These \"places\" make strange angles and curves. One Street crosses itself a time or two. An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street. Suppose a collector with a bill for paints, paper and canvas should, in traversing this route, suddenly meet himself coming back, without a cent having been paid on account!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to quaint old Greenwich Village the art people soon came prowling, hunting for north windows and eighteenth-century gables and Dutch attics and low rents. Then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from Sixth Avenue, and became a \"colony.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the top of a squatty, three-story brick Sue and Johnsy had their studio. \"Johnsy\" was familiar for Joanna. One was from Maine; the other from California. They had met at the table d'hÃ´te of an Eighth Street \"Delmonico's,\" and found their tastes in art, chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was in May. In November a cold, unseen stranger, whom the doctors called Pneumonia, stalked about the colony, touching one here and there with his icy fingers. Over on the east side this ravager strode boldly, smiting his victims by scores, but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss-grown \"places.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has one chance in - let us say, ten,\" he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. \" And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day.\" said Sue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for instance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man?\" said Sue, with a jew's-harp twang in her voice. \"Is a man worth - but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it is the weakness, then,\" said the doctor. \"I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp. Then she swaggered into Johnsy's room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle of the figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated. She went quickly to the bedside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Johnsy's eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting - counting backward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twelve,\" she said, and little later \"eleven\"; and then \"ten,\" and \"nine\"; and then \"eight\" and \"seven\", almost together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sue look solicitously out of the window. What was there to count? There was only a bare, dreary yard to be seen, and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away. An old, old ivy vine, gnarled and decayed at the roots, climbed half way up the brick wall. The cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung, almost bare, to the crumbling bricks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it, dear?\" asked Sue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six,\" said Johnsy, in almost a whisper. \"They're falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. It made my head ache to count them. But now it's easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five what, dear? Tell your Sudie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leaves. On the ivy vine. When the last one falls I must go, too. I've known that for three days. Didn't the doctor tell you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I never heard of such nonsense,\" complained Sue, with magnificent scorn. \"What have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well? And you used to love that vine so, you naughty girl. Don't be a goosey. Why, the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were - let's see exactly what he said - he said the chances were ten to one! Why, that's almost as good a chance as we have in New York when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building. Try to take some broth now, and let Sudie go back to her drawing, so she can sell the editor man with it, and buy port wine for her sick child, and pork chops for her greedy self.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't get any more wine,\" said Johnsy, keeping her eyes fixed out the window. \"There goes another. No, I don't want any broth. That leaves just four. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I'll go, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Johnsy, dear,\" said Sue, bending over her, \"will you promise me to keep your eyes closed, and not look out the window until I am done working? I must hand those drawings in by to-morrow. I need the light, or I would draw the shade down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't you draw in the other room?\" asked Johnsy, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd rather be here by you,\" said Sue. \"Beside, I don't want you to keep looking at those silly ivy leaves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me as soon as you have finished,\" said Johnsy, closing her eyes, and lying white and still as fallen statue, \"because I want to see the last one fall. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of thinking. I want to turn loose my hold on everything, and go sailing down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try to sleep,\" said Sue. \"I must call Behrman up to be my model for the old hermit miner. I'll not be gone a minute. Don't try to move 'til I come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them. He was past sixty and had a Michael Angelo's Moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along with the body of an imp. Behrman was a failure in art. Forty years he had wielded the brush without getting near enough to touch the hem of his Mistress's robe. He had been always about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it. For several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising. He earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional. He drank gin to excess, and still talked of his coming masterpiece. For the rest he was a fierce little old man, who scoffed terribly at softness in any one, and who regarded himself as especial mastiff-in-waiting to protect the two young artists in the studio above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sue found Behrman smelling strongly of juniper berries in his dimly lighted den below. In one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twenty-five years to receive the first line of the masterpiece. She told him of Johnsy's fancy, and how she feared she would, indeed, light and fragile as a leaf herself, float away, when her slight hold upon the world grew weaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Behrman, with his red eyes plainly streaming, shouted his contempt and derision for such idiotic imaginings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vass!\" he cried. \"Is dere people in de world mit der foolishness to die because leafs dey drop off from a confounded vine? I haf not heard of such a thing. No, I will not bose as a model for your fool hermit-dunderhead. Vy do you allow dot silly pusiness to come in der brain of her? Ach, dot poor leetle Miss Yohnsy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is very ill and weak,\" said Sue, \"and the fever has left her mind morbid and full of strange fancies. Very well, Mr. Behrman, if you do not care to pose for me, you needn't. But I think you are a horrid old - old flibbertigibbet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are just like a woman!\" yelled Behrman. \"Who said I will not bose? Go on. I come mit you. For half an hour I haf peen trying to say dot I am ready to bose. Gott! dis is not any blace in which one so goot as Miss Yohnsy shall lie sick. Some day I vill baint a masterpiece, and ve shall all go away. Gott! yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to the window-sill, and motioned Behrman into the other room. In there they peered out the window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other for a moment without speaking. A persistent, cold rain was falling, mingled with snow. Behrman, in his old blue shirt, took his seat as the hermit miner on an upturned kettle for a rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sue awoke from an hour's sleep the next morning she found Johnsy with dull, wide-open eyes staring at the drawn green shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pull it up; I want to see,\" she ordered, in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wearily Sue obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, lo! after the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the livelong night, there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on the vine. Still dark green near its stem, with its serrated edges tinted with the yellow of dissolution and decay, it hung bravely from the branch some twenty feet above the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the last one,\" said Johnsy. \"I thought it would surely fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall to-day, and I shall die at the same time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear, dear!\" said Sue, leaning her worn face down to the pillow, \"think of me, if you won't think of yourself. What would I do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Johnsy did not answer. The lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious, far journey. The fancy seemed to possess her more strongly as one by one the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day wore away, and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall. And then, with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed, while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the low Dutch eaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was light enough Johnsy, the merciless, commanded that the shade be raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ivy leaf was still there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Johnsy lay for a long time looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was stirring her chicken broth over the gas stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've been a bad girl, Sudie,\" said Johnsy. \"Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked I was. It is a sin to want to die. You may bring a me a little broth now, and some milk with a little port in it, and - no; bring me a hand-mirror first, and then pack some pillows about me, and I will sit up and watch you cook.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And hour later she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sudie, some day I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor came in the afternoon, and Sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Even chances,\" said the doctor, taking Sue's thin, shaking hand in his. \"With good nursing you'll win.\" And now I must see another case I have downstairs. Behrman, his name is - some kind of an artist, I believe. Pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man, and the attack is acute. There is no hope for him; but he goes to the hospital to-day to be made more comfortable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day the doctor said to Sue: \"She's out of danger. You won. Nutrition and care now - that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And that afternoon Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woollen shoulder scarf, and put one arm around her, pillows and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have something to tell you, white mouse,\" she said. \"Mr. Behrman died of pneumonia to-day in the hospital. He was ill only two days. The janitor found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold. They couldn't imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night. And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been dragged from its place, and some scattered brushes, and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it, and - look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn't you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it's Behrman's masterpiece - he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.\"\n",
